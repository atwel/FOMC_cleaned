This week we've had  the  opposite pattern of  borrowing early  in  the week in  a very  tight market and the  banks are now being left with  excess reserves.  Just  for the  moment, it's  a somewhat easier money market.  Steve described generally where we are  on the aggregates  which, to  summarize,  is  on  the high side  on  the  broader aggregates--where  we've been  all  along, or  for  the  last  couple of months anyway.  They are not moving particularly strongly at  the moment but  they are on  the  high  side.  M1 is  right  in  the middle  of the  long-run path,  if  you consider  that  significant, but  above where we want  it  to  be at  this point.  We  have reduced  the  nonborrowed reserve path  for  other  than multiplier reasons  in the  light of  the  \f5/6/81  higher-than-desired total  reserves,  leaving us with  something  in  the neighborhood of  $2 billion of borrowings.  I'm not  sure  that  any great  decision has  to be  taken here.  In  terms  of  the  target,  I think we have  to  recognize that  at  the moment we're running high, but we meet  formally again  in  a few weeks and we will  reassess  that  target.  I'm not  sure  that there's  any need to  put down  another target  formally  for  the  next  two weeks.  We recognize that  we  are high;  we recognize  that  in our operations.  We do  have  a federal  funds  checkpoint, or whatever, which is  13  to  18 percent.  It  has  generally been  fluctuating above that  in  recent  days. And, today, I think we have  to  recognize  that somehow or another.  But I would suggest  that we don't have  to  take any decisions  on money supply targets per  se.  We would recognize  that we are running high and describe the  situation--I'm just  thinking now in terms  of  what  we might say in  the  brief paragraphs we write  [in  the policy record] about a telephone consultation--and recognize  that we've made some adjustments  in  the  reserve path.  And there we are.  There  is  always the question  of  the precise reserve path and where we are,  if  anybody wants  to  comment  on  that.  I'm not  sure  I see  anything in  these most recent money supply figures  that  suggests  any big  change in  that.  We can certainly maintain that  kind of  borrowing  level  regardless of  the fact  that  these  last estimates  are a shade  lower than our previous estimates."], [11, "If  I may interject before Steve  answers:  It's not worth a damn.

I'll  tell  you what  I have written down here.  Don't  hold me to  this  word for word, but  to capture  the sense  of  it  I would say:  We held a consultation  on May 6. The  Committee agreed  that  in the period between now and the next regularly  scheduled meeting on May  18th--that's  only  two weeks we're talking about--the  reserve paths  should continue to  be  set  on the basis  of  the money supply  path established at  the  last meeting.  It  is recognized  that actual  money growth may be  high  for  a  time  relative to that path,  in view of  the  recent  performance of  the  aggregates.  In the  light  of  this  approach,  the  Committee recognized that  short-term market  interest  rates might  well  fluctuate around  levels  prevailing in  \frecent days, which by  implication says we're not  [constrained]  by  the 18  percent,  and the  Committee agreed to  consult  further  if  the monetary growth rate  does not  abate."], [33, "This  particular version  is written  on the  assumption that  we've had our  consultation, related in part  to  the federal  funds  rate  range,  and we  say that we  anticipate the  rate  is going to  be around recent  rates, which carries  us into  the  18  to  20 percent  area by  implication.  But  it  just  does  it  by implication."], [35, "Oh,  I just  think  it  avoids  controversy  about what  the new limit is.  I don't mean controversy in the Committee particularly, but just  that  these people who  look at  what we say with great  precision would say that  we  really were aiming at  20 percent  or whatever."], [37, "You have  expressed my feelings  more  eloquently  than I did,  Governor Gramley."], [39, "Well,  I had  that  in mind with  this  proposal,  Frank.  My  own conclusion  is  that  the net result of  that last  [episode]  was highly constructive.  Now,  opinions may change on that,  but by doing something a little different  I think we may finally get  them  to  look at  it  in  a little different way.  This  is  only meant to  reinforce  that  feeling.  I was  just a little  afraid that  if  we either use the  word  \"suspend,\"  a slightly awkward word, which is  one thing we  can say, or  if we  say  [the  upper  end]  is  20  percent,  they would go back and say:  \"Well, it  really is  a constraint.\"  That's why I tried  to  avoid it.  Something precisely along  the  lines  of  Governor Gramley's reasoning  is  what  I had in  mind.  But  it's  a psychological point  in  terms  of  how people  read  it.  My conclusion was  that  it would be  less  confusing doing it  this  way because  I really do  think that  it was  worth the  few days'  confusion it  caused that  other time.  \f5/6/81"], [42, "\"To fluctuate  around levels  prevailing  in  recent weeks\"  is  what  I happen to  have written  down here."], [44, "\"Recent days\"  [is  actually what]  I have."], [46, "I don't think  so.

There is  nothing magic  in  these words  or  the particular  formulation.  We  could say \"agreed to  consult  further  if  necessary to maintain  adequate  restraint on  the rate  of monetary growth\"  or  something  like  that."], [54, "Yes."], [56, "But  I don't  think  I really have,  Roger,  if  I may just  interrupt.  This  is  all  filled with subtleties  in  some sense;  pay your money and take  your choice.  But this  says  we recognize  that market  interest  rates might well  fluctuate around levels prevailing  in recent  days  or  in the past week, whatever  the wording is.  I  think, by implication  there,  if  the  rate were widely different  from that,  it  would be  an excuse  for  consulting.  Then  it goes  on  to  say explicitly  something about the  aggregates.  So,  I don't think we've  lost  any sense  of  consulting here.  I don't  know that  it will  be necessary in  the next  two weeks,  but  I would read  this  to  mean that  if  things were  drastically different, particularly on  the up side, we would  consult."], [58, "What  I am  saying  is  that  I think  it has  both in there."], [60, "We  can do  that.  It's  a matter  of  preference.  My own judgment,  in  this particular  instance,  is  that  it would be more confusing and not  less  confusing  in  one sense.  I think we really have  the  [better]  market  [understanding now]  after  some confusion.  The confusion  is  not entirely  absent now;  it's  a question of which way to  diminish it.  Doing  something that  sounds quite consistent with what we  did  last  time,  I think, will  put us  ahead of  \f5/6/81  the  game  and not  behind it.  That has no  implications  to me  for what we do with the  range at  the  next  Committee meeting.  We can obviously discuss  that,  but  I think  that's  something we  can discuss when we're here  face-to-face  [at  the next meeting]."], [62, "Just  to  be clear, what  I'm a little  afraid  of--whatever language  I played with  for  all  of  three minutes before coming in  here--is that  if  we change  the  range,  the  confusion will come down  to  [why]  we  set  a range  for  such a short period of  time. The market  will  say:  \"Well, what  the  Committee  tried  to  tell  us  last time  really  isn't right.  They really have  a great  concern about  [the funds  rate],  particularly if  they were worried about  it  for  a two-week period.  And they put  it  right  on  top of  the present market rate;  that must mean that  what  they  tried to  tell us  last time  wasn't true.\" That's what  I'm worried about."], [64, "I guess  what we're  saying is  that  there  is  no  perfectly nonconfusing way of  doing this.  The  question is:  In which direction do we want  to  go?  I just have  the  gut  feeling that language  that  establishes  a new range  for such a short period, against what we  just did, will  create  the  confusion in  the  opposite direction."], [68, "I have no  trouble  in principle with what Tony and John  are  suggesting.  The trouble  is  that  it's  very hard  to put  it  in  language  that  does not  say:  Right now  this  doesn't make much difference, but ordinarily we  take  it very seriously.  It's  easy to  read that  into  it.  That's  the only  reason  I came  up with this language, not  that  I have  any disagreement  in principle.  That's what we're doing;  we are  suspending  [the  ceiling].  When we use the word \"suspend,\"  given  the  confusion  that  has  existed,  it  sounds  as  if  in other cases we would have been very apt  not  to  suspend it.

We  can  try to  get  some words  that  mention  the  range.  That  last formulation didn't  sound too  bad to me  off  the  top  of  my head.  I don't  think it  prejudices  anybody;  it  just  recognizes  that  the  funds rate  is  going to  be  above  what we  said was  the  consultation point before, which  is  a factual  report."], [89, "Well,  the basic  issue  is  whether we want  to  do anything more;  I guess  that  is  an  important  issue.  I would propose no  substantive new directive.  I don't know whether we need to put  anything  down here except  for  that point.  I would propose that  we not  change  the money supply  targets.  And, apart  from what we  say  in the  language,  you understand that we've  tightened up  on the  reserves and we won't,  at  the moment,  do  it  appreciably further.

The only other  information we've picked up  relates  to  some very early information on worker hours  in manufacturing  for  the month  of April, and  that  seems  to  have risen  a bit.  We  would infer  from that  and  from information we know on auto production  and some other physical product data that  industrial production probably will  be  rising  1/4  to  1/2 percent or  something  like  that  for  the month  of April."]], "SPEAKER": [[4, "No  is  right."], [113, "Not  the  last  telephone meeting,  the  last--"], [115, "The  last  time  we  [went  beyond]  one end  of  the  [funds  rate]  range."], [120, "Yes."]], "MR AXILROD": [[6, "Mr. Chairman, we  have  some very tentative new numbers on  the aggregates.  They have the  normal  tentativeness  for  a Wednesday;  they will  change by  tomorrow and perhaps  a little more by Friday.  The preliminary data  for  the week of April  29th had  suggested a decline  of  $1 billion  from the week of  the  22nd.  The more complete data, which might be  somewhat  firm--that's  the week we're  going to publish on  Friday--now suggest  a decline  of  about  $3-1/2  billion  from the week of  the 22nd.  That would be followed,  I hasten  to  add, by  an increase,  if  the numbers  hold up, of  about  $3 billion  in  the  week of May 6th.  This  looks  offsetting, but  in  a real  sense  the  level  of  the series for  both the  29th  and the  6th  is  lower  than had been built  into the paths.  So,  the  level  of  the series  is  lower  on average by about $2 billion  in both weeks, April  29th  and May 6th.  The  changes  are,  as I mentioned above, about  offsetting.  This  figure would give  us a shift-adjusted April  rate  of  growth--I  can't  be very precise--probably on  the  order of  14  percent  or  something like  that.  And that  would put the  April  level of  M-1B  almost right  smack in  the middle  of  the Committee's  3-1/2  to  6 percent  long-run shift-adjusted range.  That, of course,  is  somewhat higher  than  the Committee had been aiming  at by April,  but  it's  still  well within  the range.  I don't have  any new data  for M2  yet  for April,  but  the  data  we had as  of Friday would have  had the  level  of  M2  in  the  month somewhat  above  the Committee's  long-run growth  range, viewed  as  a triangle.  M3  in April  is  also  somewhat  above  the  range.  And bank credit growth, which is  [uncertain]  because we don't have  good estimates yet  for April,  by March had been moving  down toward  the range.  I don't  believe  that  the growth  in April  will  be very  far from, and probably will  be lower  than, the  9 percent  upper  limit  of the Committee's  range.  So,  I think by April  it's possible  that  bank credit will  be  at or near  the upper  end of  its  range.  We have been running with a reserve path that  would imply  in the  current  week  \fborrowing of  around  $2 billion.  Borrowing started out  very high earlier, before  the weekend, and it  has been  running  about  $1-1/2 billion since  then,  as banks have  had large  excess reserves  that they've been working down.  In consequence  of  this,  as  you know, within the week there was  some  easing;  we've had a drop  in  the  funds rate  from  the very high levels  it  had reached earlier.  It,  too, has been  easing down  as banks  have adjusted their positions within  the week.  But,  Mr. Chairman, perhaps Mr. Sternlight would want  to comment on  the particular developments  in market rates  that  have  followed the discount rate move."], [12, "I was  going to  say  it's  very much a guess, but  we see,  of  course,  a diminution  from April.  If  I had to  put a range around our guess,  I would say  the rate  of  growth  for May is probably in a range of  6 to  9 percent  [for  M-1B].  Something  on  that  order of magnitude would still  leave us with a pretty high growth rate  in M-1B for  the  [second]  quarter  on  average.

I can give you the  weekly figures. The path  for  total  reserves  is  a little over  $40,400 million.  That is,  for  this  period of  three weeks,  actual  total  reserves  appear to  be running about  $500  million above what the path  for  total  reserves would call  for.

Rates had  already been moving up in  the wake of  the very tight  conclusion  to  the  previous reserve week, the  week ending  the 29th, and  then when the  money supply number  was published Friday, there  was a further  upward rate  move.  And after  the  discount rate action on Monday there were  still  further  increases,  leaving  the market  in a very demoralized state,  I'd  say, early yesterday morning. From that point,  things  seemed to gel better;  sentiment  turned around to  some extent.  But  there has been a lot  of  worry about whether  the Treasury would get  any kind of  decent bidding  for  its  three-year auction.  It  turned out  to  be  very substantial  bidding at  the rates that developed as  that  auction went  on.  The  [auction  average]  rate was  a record high,  15.8  percent.  But  earlier  that day  the market was talking about  16 percent  or  higher.  Today the  atmosphere continues  to improve.  The  10-year auction has been held, with offering rates  of around 14.55  or  14.60 percent, again fairly good.  And market rates have come down  from the  peaks  they hit yesterday morning:  The 3-month rate, which had touched  17  percent,  is  down  to  about  the  15-1/2 percent  area;  the  CD rate had touched 19  percent  for  the  3-month issue and now it's  around  18-1/2 percent.  As  Steve mentioned, we had a high funds  rate  at  the  beginning  of  this week, which I think was probably more a function of  an  extremely tight  ending of  the April  29th week than  of  our own  effort  to  control  reserve restraint  on the  system. The  funds  rate  had been  averaging  20 percent  on Thursday and Friday and then  it worked its way down, partly with  the  help of  substantial borrowing over  the weekend.  The  funds  rate  today started out  around 17-1/2  percent and it's  around the  17  or  16-1/2  percent area  this afternoon.  That's  all  I have."]], "MR BOEHNE": [[10, "This  is  Ed Boehne.

If  you're  that  insistent about  not wanting to  project  that  emphasis on  the  fed  funds rate,  it  does prejudice--and maybe rightfully so--the  whole question  of  whether we have  a fed  funds range  in  the  future  or not,  because I don't understand why you would have  that  concern now  and you wouldn't have  that  concern  twelve days from now."], [85, "Yes,  I  think that  language  is  an  improvement.

And what  we have  done,  if  we  go  this  route,  is  that we have  demonstrated in  effect  that  this  is not  a binding range but a checkpoint.

I was  sitting here  trying  to  think of  some wording that would be more amenable  to  the  group.

That  did create  some  confusion initially, but  the  message  is  getting  through  to  so-called Fed watchers not  to overinterpret  every little  tick  or movement  of  the  fed funds  rate.  You  might  consider  tacking  on a  sentence  at  the  end,  in light  of  the  comments we just  had on  confusion  about which days we mean, to underline  further  the  fact  that we  are  continuing  to  stress keeping the  aggregates under  control and  deemphasizing  the  importance of  these particular  trigger points."], [51, "That would be  great.

If  you look back prior  to February 24th, for almost  two years we've  been trying  to convey the  message that  the  funds  rate  band is  a consultation point. We've also  been trying  to  convey the message  that when it has  been hit,  consultations  have been held and  in  one way or  another, explicitly  or  implicitly, and when the  forces  have  dictated, we effectively have waived  it.  I think  that  putting new numbers  around it  in  the  context  of  the  current  situation works  in  exactly the opposite direction;  it  reinforces  the view that  we're playing  footsies with  the  funds  rate.  To me  the language  the  Chairman has  suggested is clear enough.  It does by  implication  say that  something  in the  area of  20  percent  is  fine.  But  by  implication  it  also  says  that  something like  25  percent  isn't  fine,  and if  we  found the  rate moving  in  that  \f5/6/81  direction, we'd have  another  consultation.  I think  that's what  the market,  at  least  as  I read it,  is  looking  for.

Events  are  such that we  do  have the  opportunity to  continue  that  deemphasis.  I think we  should go ahead and take  the opportunity, and I would hope  that  at  the next  FOMC meeting we could have  a very thorough discussion  about  exactly what we want  to  do with that  funds  rate range."]], "MR RICE": [[74, "I  like  the  language  as  it  is."]], "MR BERNARD": [[106, "It  doesn't  seem so."], [122, "Chairman Volcker  Vice Chairman  Solomon  President  Boehne  President  Boykin  Governor Gramley  Governor Rice  Governor Schultz  Governor Teeters  President Winn   It's  unanimous.
