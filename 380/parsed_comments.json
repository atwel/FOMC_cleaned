[Foreign officials]  are  a little  ambivalent  about it.  They're in the  same  position we are.  They want  to maintain this  psychological posture of  getting on top  of  inflation  and not appearing  to  yield to it.  And they haven't had much improvement on  the  inflation  front, although in  some countries  they've had a little.  On the  other hand, they're becoming a little worried about  a business  slowdown and perhaps a world recession and  [there  is]  some  sentiment  that easing might be  a good idea.

If  we  sell  some gold and then immediately get  some  congressional  opposition, the market would say: \"Well, they're not  going to  sell  very much because  there's  too much opposition.\"  And, therefore,  it might not  be very productive  in  terms of  the  impact we'd want  to  achieve."], [74, "Perhaps  I spoke  a little misleadingly  because  that  kind of  opposition, I think, does  reflect  on the credibility of  the  action.

Then  there was  a  footnote on  page  3 that  said we  changed the  target  [for  total  reserves]  and made  it  a  little higher;  but  it  said  the  original  target  was  $43,377 million and  the subsequent  target  was  $43,293  million, which is  lower."], [85, "But  the  footnote  seems  to be wrong on page  3.

[Before]  we  turn  to  the economic  situation,  I might  just  [raise]  another point here  so  that you  are  aware  of  it.  You might already be  aware of  it;  I believe you have been sent  a copy of  the resolution that  Mr.  Proxmire  and Senator  Garn have  introduced  about Federal  Reserve  policy.  This  arose  essentially out  of  the report  by Arthur Burns'  Committee  to Fight  Inflation, which  is  made up  of  an ex- Secretary of  the  Treasury, an  ex-Chairman of  the  Federal  Reserve Board, and a  few distinguished ex-Congressmen.  Among other  things  the report  said  that  Congress,  as  Mr. Burns had  suggested  in a speech  last September,  ought  to  support  the  long-term thrust  of monetary policy toward restraint  against  inflation and ought  to reinforce  that commitment by  a Congressional  resolution.  That  language was  in  the Committee's report  and apparently Mr.  Proxmire  read that  and  thought it was  a good idea.  So  he has  introduced  a resolution, the  language of  which I have examined  in  its present  form word by word.  It  seems fairly unexceptional  but  I have  a little  concern,  frankly, about  the whole  exercise.  It  starts off with all  these  [whereas phrases]-- whereas  the Congress  has  the  constitutional power, and whereas  the Federal  Reserve  is  an agent  of  the  Congress,  and whereas  the  Congress can  tell  the  Federal  Reserve what to  do,  whereas  this  and whereas that--[and then says]  we  support  [the  Federal  Reserve]  in  this  general long-range  intention  [to  restrain inflation].  It  seems  to me  the  kind of  language that  could easily be converted in  some  other circumstances to  say whereas we  think interest  rates  are  too high we  direct you  to lower  interest  rates.  So,  it  may not be  the most  desirable precedent in  the world, but  I'm not  sure  there  is  anything we  can do  about  it. I just  have a  little worry  about  it.  We have  not been active  in supporting  this  but we have not  been active in working against  it either.  My own  [instinct]  is  to  let  events  take  their course.  But there may be  an effort--and  there's  danger  in  this--to put  in some different  language  in  the  operative paragraphs  that  could give us  a little difficulty.  We will  wait and see,  I guess.  As  it  is,  I think it's unexceptional.  I don't  know how helpful  it  really  is,  but you ought  to  be aware  of  it.  Maybe  it  is helpful;  I don't  know."], [134, "It  worries me  a  little,  frankly.  I'd just  as  soon  it  didn't  come  up.  I discussed it  with Arthur  and I'm  not sure he's  so  happy himself  that  this  [process]  has  started.  I'm sure he's  convinced  that  he  thought  it  all  through, but  I don't  know what we  can do."], [136, "A  couple  of weeks  ago."], [138, "Well,  the main difference between  [the  current version]  and what was  initially  introduced is  that  the  first sentence  talked  about  the  long  run anti-inflationary  policy and so forth--I  can't  remember  the  language--but  had a phrase  in  it  about long-term  interest  rates.  It  said, in  effect,  that  [such  a policy] could bring down  long-term interest  rates  in the  context  of  dealing with inflation.  Arthur got  them  to  take  out  the  specific  reference  to interest rates.  In fact,  the  reference wasn't bad because  it  was  in the  context  of  bringing  down  inflation.  But  it's  illustrative of  the kinds  of  things we  could get  in  a resolution of  this  sort  some  time  in the  future  that  would be very difficult.  Looking at  this, my  own feeling is  that  we can't  go out  and  say we don't  [favor]  a resolution that  says  Congress  supports  our  long-term efforts  to  deal with inflation.  But  I feel  a little  nervous  about  the  implications  of  this for the  future.  Indeed, there may be an attempt  to  modify this  in  the present.  What  I am  saying  is  that  if  it  just  died quietly,  I wouldn't shed enormous  tears;  there may be  some  other aspects  of  this  that aren't  apparent.  Undoubtedly,  I will be asked  to  comment  about  it  in my testimony.  I suppose  I am  forced to  say it's  a  fine  resolution."], [141, "Yes,  I could  say that  I don't  think  it  is  wise  for  these resolutions  to  be  all  that  specific but  that  a resolution with this  kind of general  sentiment  is  [fine]."], [143, "I did ask  if  there  had ever been a  resolution quite  like  this,  referring  to  policy.  And I  think  it  is  \ftrue--well,  at  least nobody was able  to  tell  me  off-hand--that  there has  not been.  The nearest  thing to  it  was  the  concurrent  resolution, adopted in  [1975],  which  in part  gave rise  to  the whole monetary targeting exercise.  In  some  of  its  initial  versions  that  did  talk about  interest rates;  [those  phrases]  were pretty much extracted, so the  resolution became  largely procedural  instead  of  referring  to  the objective  of  policy except  in  the  broadest way.  But there  have been many attempts  to  introduce resolutions  like  this.  There has  been a resolution  circulating  in Congress  in recent  months  about bringing down  interest rates.  It never got  anywhere, but  it  had some signatures  on it.  There  have been  other attempts  of  that kind, which weren't pressed very hard.  We weren't  able  to  find  any precedent  for this  kind of  thing  actually passing  in Congress.  I don't  know if there  is  anything else  to be  said about  it  but  I  thought  I'd ask  for any  reactions  you had.

We will  spend  a little time  here  on  the  economic  outlook before we get  to  the aggregates discussion.  Your  forecast,  obviously, has  a very low recovery  in disposable  income  in  '81  by historical standards.  You  also have a low increase  in productivity.  When we have  a low increase  in  productivity  somehow we have  to  have a low increase  in  disposable  income.  But  there's  a certain amount  of chicken and  egg  involved;  if we had a faster recovery, we might  get more productivity.  I guess  I'm groping  for a question here.  How low does  the  rise in  disposable  income have  to be  [to  reflect]  the  fact that  productivity is  not performing  the way it  used  to  and how much  is [related  to]  a sluggish  recovery in  some  sense?"], [158, "Well,  how much  of  it  is  the  other way around?

Nothing looks  very happy, except Mr. Winn's  last interjection.  As  I judge  this,  we have  a problem in  that  if  we base our  analysis  on any kind of  traditional  analysis, econometric  or other,  we run into  all  sorts  of dilemmas.  And it makes  one wonder how all  this  can be  reconciled except by saying:  \"Let's have a more expansive budget  and a more expansive monetary policy and  then everything will  look  all  right  on  these  traditional  grounds.\"  That's if  we  ignore  the  inflationary implications, which I take  it  we  can't ignore.  That is  the  dilemma we have.  We don't  have a situation where we  can play the  game  the way we have played  it  traditionally.  I don't think we  can,  anyway.  Well,  if  we are  going  to  have any coffee break at  all,  we  can go  chew on that physically as  well as mentally for  a few minutes  and come back and enter  into  the policy  discussion.  [Coffee break]"], [291, "We  spent a long  time on  the business  outlook;  I think we  should have spent  a long  time because  [the  staff presentation]  was  interesting and illustrated  some  of  our problems very amply.  But I don't  think we  are going to  get beyond the  long- term ranges  before  lunch,  so  I suspect we will  [continue  the meeting] after  lunch.  We have to  consider these  forecasts  a little, in preparation  for  the Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony.  We have  some  figures, as  you know, from  the  Presidents  and  from  the  Board members, and we ought  to  have at  least a little  discussion about how  they came  out  and how they  should be presented.  Let me defer  that  for  later.  I guess it  could  be argued  that we  ought  to  do  that  before the policy [decision],  but  I won't be  that logical.  I'll  do  it  afterwards.  But I do  think we need  some  time to  discuss non-monetary policy matters. So  [the meeting]  may run a fair amount of  time  this  afternoon.  I won't  try to  finish before  lunch;  our meeting will have  to  continue afterwards  anyway.  I hope  to  finish  [our  work on]  the  long-term aggregates before  lunch  at  the very  least.  I have  the  sense,  as  I suggested before, that  this  presentation  of  the business outlook, which is  based upon past relationships  and  past performance  of  the  economy, does point up very well  our  dilemmas  and  the basic  issue we  face.  It's a philosophical question almost  as  to how we approach a system which  in  some sense has run  out  of  steam  in terms  of  the postwar presumptions, if  I can put  it so grandly.  The economy has been getting  less  liquid  for  30  years. We have had rising  inflation  for  15  years,  I suppose.  Both of  those factors,  and I'm  sure  some  others, have  changed the  nature of  the economy  and the nature  of  expectations,  and  they have  implications  for cyclical  analysis.  If  one  assumed that  expectations were  stable  in some sense  and weren't  affected by inflation, the  overwhelming thrust of  what  comes  out  of  the  business  analysis  is  that we  should have  a big tax cut,  an  easier budget,  and a substantial  increase  in  the monetary aggregates,  and everything will  go  along happily on past cyclical  grounds.  We'd have  room for  a bigger recovery and everything would move as  it  did in previous  cycles.  We  could look ahead,  if  not  \fhappily, on  a more  or less  even course  [consistent]  with past history. I doubt  that  it will  be  so  simple because  expectations will be affected.  We will  get  financial market  repercussions  from  that kind of policy  that  are probably  inconsistent with that  [historic] evolution.  We'll  get exchange market  reactions  that would be inconsistent with following  that  course.  I don't  think there's  so simple an  answer.  It's  not  the  answer that  our policy  to date, anyway, has  suggested.  On  the other hand,  the opposite view--that  if we just  keep clamping down  on the money supply all  the  problems are going  to  disappear nicely and the  inflation rates  are going to  come down much faster  than these  projections show and the  various dilemmas will  be  reconciled in  the next year  or  two  in  a very happy kind of way--doesn't  leave  one feeling  entirely comfortable  in the  pit of one's  stomach.  At  least not me.  I suppose  it's  a matter  of  raising the questions;  it's  not  only what we should be  doing, but what we  think the  analog should be in other public  policies, whether fiscal  policy or wage-price policy or otherwise.  Those are appropriate questions, particularly for me. I think  they are  always  appropriate  for  the  Committee but there's  a certain spate  of  testimony we have  to  deliver  in the  next couple  of weeks  on  a whole range  of  economic  problems,  from monetary policy  to fiscal  policy, to wage-price policy,  to  silver,  to  the Monetary Control Act  and everything else.  So we do  have  to  think implicitly or explicitly about  complementary policies  as well  as  about our own policy and approaches.  With  that  very general  introduction, maybe Mr. Axilrod  can  set  out  the more specific  considerations with respect  to where we  go on  the  aggregates  this  year and next.  Let me just  say one  other  thing  in that  connection.  We  obviously have  to  review  the  aggregates and announce a rather  specific conclusion  for  this  year.  We also  have to  say  something about next year, but  the  degree  of  specificity with which we  state  [our objectives  for]  next year is  quite an  open question.  We  can go  all the way from saying these  are  our preliminary ranges--we wouldn't say final  in any event--for M-1A, M-1B, M2, M3,  and bank credit in  a manner  similar  to  what we would do  for 1980  to  the  other extreme of indicating a qualitative  direction.  Or we  can alight anyplace  in between those  two extremes.  It  is  an open question we  should resolve regarding whether we want to  go with one  of  those  extremes or  some place  in  between in  terms  of what we  say  in the Humphrey-Hawkins report. I think  it's useful  to  be as  specific  as  we  can be  in  the first  go-around here--as specific  as  we can in getting  individual views,  however generally we  want  to  [cast  it]  as  a consensus  for  the Humphrey-Hawkins report."], [293, "You did not  consider the possibility--  maybe  it  shouldn't be  considered, but  let me  raise  it--of  correcting, in a sense,  the M-1A/M-1B relationships  for what  has gone  on so  far."], [295, "But  that's  not  reflected  in  the  ranges you  are  proposing."], [297, "Theoretically, we  have  the  option  of--"], [299, "Just  to put  this  in  context:  The  charts that  you have drawn  later  [in  the  Bluebook]  for  the  short-run ranges are  based upon what we  know through June.

I don't  suggest  that we  should necessarily do  it,  but we  should have  that  in mind.  That  is,  we  ought to  reject it  consciously if  we don't  do  it,  because  one can make the  argument  in pure logic  that we  ought  to be  a little more certain now about where we  are going  to end up at  the  end of  the year than when the year began.

On  taxes,  first  of  all,  let  me just  say  that  I  [expect]  to be  asked  to  testify  formally  on  taxes,  as  \fit will  be  coming up before other  committees.  In a sense, what  I say would be my personal  testimony, but the  question is  to  what  extent  I can speak  for a wider  group  if  asked.  There  seems  to  be a consensus, though not  everybody spoke  to  the point  of what we want  as  opposed to what we  expect,  that  there  is  no  eagerness  for moving on  taxes immediately  in a broad-brush way.  There  may be  differing  degrees  of sympathy for  a tax  cut  eventually.  I think everybody would  say  it depends  partly on conditions.  But  the  idea of  trying  to  [delay its enactment]  is  certainly widely accepted  [by  this  group]  as  nearly as  I can see  [as  is  the  view that]  the  cuts  ought  to  be  gauged as  much as possible  in  terms of  their  direct  impact  on prices  and costs  and productivity.  There  is  considerable sentiment--I  don't  know what I think about  this  frankly--[for reducing]  the payroll  tax.  I recognize the benefits but  I also worry about  the  future  of  the  social  security discipline  if payroll taxes  are  [not  imposed]  directly.  But  I recognize  that it  is  a major avenue  to  look  at  in connection with  the tax cut  program.  I could probably speak pretty broadly by saying  that there is  a desire for  this  to  be  looked at  later and not right now and not be  too  definite about the  later.  The  later could conceivably mean at  least  September but preferably after  the  election.  On  the  wage-price issue,  there's a greater difference  of  opinion, obviously.  I don't have  any  set view on  this  at  the moment but I have  a feeling that the  pessimism  [about  the  effectiveness of the program]  that  has been expressed by the  staff  is widely accepted in  our  thinking in  terms  of  the  difficulty of  [making progress  on]  the wage side  of  the  [equation].  I'm not  sure  there's  anything to  be lost,  frankly, by saying that  if you people  in the  Congress  are talking about  a tax cut,  a pre-requisite you ought  to  think about among other  things,  is  a concord between labor, business and government  on a guideline that's  substantially below  the present guideline.  [This has  to  be done]  in  the context  of  all  the problems we have,  including  the potentially  inflationary implications  and all the rest.  I don't  think it  does much  good to  talk about  guidelines  in the  present  area.  But  I'm not  sure  there's  anything the matter with stating that  as  an objective  at  the  moment.  And to  the  extent we raise  the  issue,  it may  even slow  down  the  immediate drive  for a tax cut until we  all  see how  things  develop  over  the remainder  of  the year.  Now, that's  purely a personal  reaction at  this  stage, but  I'm not  sure  there's anything to be  lost by  it.  I'd go  all  the way by somehow relating  it more  specifically to wage  increases but  I don't know how to do  it.  If  anybody had a bright  idea on that  score,  it probably would have been thought  of  already.  Not  that your  idea wasn't bright, Henry.  I don't  suppose I could speak more broadly about  that  approach but  I have  some  sympathy  for putting  it  that way as  part of  an argument  for deferring consideration of  the  tax  cut  at the  moment.  On monetary policy itself,  the  consensus  is  pretty clearly  to  keep the ranges  unchanged for  1980.  I basically agree  with that  in terms  of  simplicity in presentation.  It  bothers me  a little because some things  are  going on  that would justify  a change,  and in ordinary circumstances they ought  to be  recognized.  Even on  a technical  level, on  the  relationship between M-1A and M-1B--which is  a pretty darn technical matter due  to  the NOW accounts--ordinarily we would say we [now]  have more  experience and we  ought  to  adjust  that  relationship. But  I recognize  the  arguments  that  were presented pretty  fully around the  table  for  taking the  simple  approach.  Most people  suggested, and  \fI would  certainly agree,  that  consistent  with that  approach we would not be  disturbed if,  as  is  likely,  the M1s  came  in  at  the  low end of the ranges.  We might  also  say  that  it's possible M2  will  come  in  at the upper  end of  its  range  and  that M3  will  be  in  the middle  or  lower part of  its  range.  But  the  ranges are  there  and we  are not  changing them partly because  they are  ranges.  Nevetheless, we  don't consider it undesirable  or  inconsistent with our  intentions  if  we have  that kind of  pattern among the ranges.  In  fact,  if  we  don't  say  that, we're almost  forced to  change  the  ranges  because  of  the  apparent inconsistency in  the  relationships  among  the  different Ms.  On bank credit  we may be  able  to  finesse along  the  lines  that have  been suggested.  That's  a little harder  to do  than  if  we hadn't put so much emphasis  on  that measure  in  connection with the  credit  control program, but  let's  suggest  that bank credit may come  in even below the lower end  of  its  range.  However, due  to  the rise  in commercial paper and so  forth that  does  not disturb us  so  greatly  that we  have  to  take it  into  account.  Let me  just  stop there.  Does  all  that  express  the consensus  for  1980  clearly enough?  We don't  change  the  ranges,  but explicitly in my comments we  say that we  are satisfied with a low M-1A and also recognize  that  M-1A probably should be  low relative  to  M-1B in  terms of  the  ranges but  that  this  is  a technical matter.  Thus  the  M1s generally might well  come  in quite  low  in  their ranges and that  would not disturb us.  M2  similarly could come  in  high in  its range and that would not disturb us,  and M3  may be near  the middle  of  its  range.  And that  is  the basis upon which we  are reaffirming the  ranges  this  year."], [409, "We  can  reopen  the question  of  '80,  but  at  this  stage  before  considering  '81,  have  I  captured  the  consensus  for the  staff  and  the writing they have  to  do  for  the  testimony?  In a very  formal  sense  the  numbers  are  the  same, but  the  interpretation  is of  some  considerable  importance here."], [411, "Okay.  For  '81  I  think we  are  in much more  difficulty,  frankly.  We have  a  real  dilemma,  inconsistency,  tension, or whatever  you want to  call  it  between the projections  and what  we'd like  to  see happen  in  the economy.  If  the  staff  estimates mean anything, in a very  straightforward way what  they  imply for  the aggregates--I'm not  saying we  should accept  it--is  higher  [rates  of growth].  On  the other hand, we can  express  the conflict  very directly by looking  at  this  resolution  that Mr.  Proxmire  has prepared, which I was  urged  to  accept  and  I'm prepared  to  accept.  The  final  clause  of that  resolution  says we are  going to  gradually  reduce the rates  of growth in monetary and credit  aggregates  in a  firm and stable manner. If we  accept  that  resolution one day,  that  presumably means  we  should be reducing  the monetary and credit  aggregates  in a  firm and stable manner,  including  in 1981.  I take  it  that  virtually everybody--there were one  or  two  contrary opinions--in resolving this  dilemma  said  [we should express  our targets  for]  1981  in qualitative  terms  and  in  \feffect waffle a bit.  I think I agree with  that.  I will  just  tell you that  it's  easier  to  say  it  around this  table.  When we  say  that  in public, people will  ask:  \"You've been putting more  emphasis  on numbers  and you've  said you were going  to  reduce the  ranges,  so why do you now refuse  to  say more  straightforwardly  that you are going to reduce them even by  1/2  or  1 percentage point  or  something?  You couldn't possibly have been suggesting  that you were going  to go more slowly  than that.\"  I attach great  significance  to  that  [argument]  and I think  there will  be  a market  reaction, too.  The market will  attach some significance  to  the  fact  that we  are not willing  to  go  up  [to  the Congressional  hearing]  and say we  are  putting  forth a lower number. It's  not  that I really disagree with  the  fact  that we  had better be qualitative.  But  it's not  as  easy  [to  carry out]  as  the  comments around here  suggested;  that  in  itself  will have  some  implications  for how our  actions are  interpreted.  Dave?"], [413, "I don't  think that  avoids  the problem,  but I agree with  what you  are saying.  Whatever else we  say about  '81 we  ought  to  say  that  there  is  a lot of uncertainty  about  the M1s  and particularly about  the relationship between M-1A and M-1B.  Somebody here put  it  very  dramatically with zero  on  one  and 7 percent on  the other  or  something  like  that.  I don't know where we will come  out  at the end  of  the year when we have  to make  those projections, but  there ought  to  be some  discussion  of  that problem and  the  fact  that  those particular numbers may look quite  different but  in  a meaningless way in a sense.  When we  actually put  forward the  numbers  they might  look different--both of  them--from what we had  in  '80.  One may be significantly  lower and the  other may be  significantly higher."], [418, "What do we have  to  say  in the  directive, Mr.  Secretary, about  1981?  Nothing, do we?

I think we  just ought  to  say  flatly that  in  the case  of  M-1A and M-1B, NOW accounts are likely  to have  a big influence.  So M-1B could well  be  above what it was  this  year  and M-1A might be below.

I'm not  sure we  can say  this,  but at  one  point  I thought we  might  say that  in  general we are moving  these  ranges  lower and we are going  to move as  fast as we  can but  it  may not be possible to do  that  next year for M2.

But let's  leave  the waffling until  a  little  later  and go  to  the  short-run decision, which may confirm or not  confirm  the  decision on  the  long- run  for  1980.  When I look at  the  alternatives put  down  for us  [in  the Bluebook]  for  these  ranges  on  the monetary aggregates,  I would reject alternative A on  a number of  grounds,  including  the immediate implications  it  may have  for  the market.  But perhaps  even  equally important  is  the consideration that  Governor  Schultz  and others  \fmentioned  about  going  full  speed ahead with a high  aggregate  figure at the moment  and a low interest  rate  only  to  have  to  screech  in  the opposite  direction in a relatively short  period of  time.  I have some of  the  same  reservations about  \"B.\"  But  \"B\" brings  us,  if  I understand  this  correctly, arithmetically to  the midpoint  of  the existing M-1A range--"], [521, "--or  just  a hair below the midpoint of  the  existing M-1A range by December.  It's  not much,  if  at  all,  above the July  figure,  I guess.  It  would surround  the  July estimate,  so  that doesn't  change  it much.  Alternative  C would bring us  inside  the  range but not  to  the midpoint by the  end of  the year, if  I am  correct."], [524, "It's  not below the  range."], [529, "The chart  shows  a September plot."], [531, "I would reject  \"a\" myself.  If  I do  that, I can  see  two ways  of  proceeding, though  I would have a rather  strong preference  for  one  of  them, that  seem consistent with what we've  just said  about  the  longer-term ranges--namely,  that we won't change  the ranges  this year, but we  would not be disturbed by being  in  the  lower part  for M1, particularly for  the M-1A number.  Consistent with that approach toward the  longer-term ranges,  it  seems to  me we could theoretically operate on  \"B.\"  And if we  didn't  like  the  results we were getting  in one  direction or  another, we'd accept  the  shortfall. I say  in  one direction or another, which operationally  in the  short run might mean running  into  the  lower  federal  funds  rate constraint. Alternatively, we  could  adopt  \"C\" for  the  initial  path-making exercise,  [using]  the  same  approach as we did  in June when it worked out, maybe by  coincidence,  to  everybody's  satisfaction.  That  involves setting a minimum growth path, which is  again  consistent with what we just  said  about the  long-term, but  if  the number  comes up higher-- consistent with both  the growth path and  the  federal  funds  rate constraint we  set  for ourselves--we'd accept  the  higher growth, for awhile anyway.  Presumably we wouldn't accept  it  forever  if  it  gets  \f7/9/80  too  high.  But in  the  short  run, presumably until  the  next meeting, we'd accept  it unless  it was very violently  high.  If we  look at  the period since May, that's what we  did.  It  happened to  come up, although we may have had some  recent  [revisions]  so  it's  a bit  higher than what we were projecting  at  the  time.  It  certainly came  up higher than we  projected it  for June.  Essentially we did not permit  the federal  funds rate  to  rebound up to  the  point  it would have rebounded had we held June  to  the number we notionally had  in mind for  that month.  The results  that were  achieved, both  in  terms  of  the  interest rate  pattern  and the aggregates  pattern, seemed to me  to  put us further toward our  ultimate objectives  than we might  otherwise have been.  It worked out  very well.  I would  interpret  \"C\" in a modified way as  a kind of  minimum growth path we'd set,  should we adopt  that.  It's  not  really  \"C\" in a sense;  it's  an indication of  the minimum growth path, and we'd accept in  the  short  run any upward deviation in  that--within some reasonable bound--by readjusting  the path consistent with the  interest rate constraints  of  the  type we now have.  That's what  I would feel  most comfortable  with.  We  may achieve  the same  result, but with different kinds of  risks, by starting with  \"B\" and  saying  in effect  that  we would undercut  \"B\" if  we ran  into  the interest  rate  constraint  on  the down side.  We would be more  likely to  run  into  the  interest  rate constraint  on  \"B,\"  assuming we have  a constraint  in  the  general neighborhood of  where we now have  it.  It  seems  to me  that  those  are the  two  practical  choices  to  focus  on, consistent with our present stand on  the  long-run ranges.

My own  feel  for  this  situation,  though  one never knows,  is  that  if  the  exchange market begins running--and  it's  \fon  the verge  of  it  now--that will  raise  the question and  force it  to our minds.  I'm  sure we'd have  differing opinions  about whether we have  to make  some  overt  \"tightening\" move  to  deal  with  the  exchange market  situation;  I think that would be more  inconsistent with what we're trying  to  do  than  accepting  this  delicate business  of  trying  to skate  through  this  period without  getting  the psychological  screws loose.  And  they're very close  to  being loose."], [583, "I might  say a word about  the  discount  rate,  too,  because  I think it's  relevant  here.  The  logic  is  to  get  it down  for basically two  reasons.  I don't  see  any reason why we should in concept have  the  discount rate  impede  reductions  in  the  prime  rate, which  at  some  point  it  may do  psychologically.  Beyond  that,  as somebody  alluded  to  this morning,  if  and when we get  a reversal  in interest  rates,  the  question is  [whether]  that might  occur  in a time period we  are worried  about.  The discount rate  then  does  have operational  significance because  it  tends  to put  a ceiling on  the funds  rate  or  at  least  slow down any increase  in  the  funds  rate.  And since  presumably we  don't want a big reaction upward  in  the  funds  rate from  a fairly technical  and maybe passing change  in  the money supply numbers,  it  would be  nice  to  get  the  discount  rate lower.  It  would be more  than nice;  I think we  ought  to  try to  do  it.  The problem we  run into  again involves  domestic  and  international psychological  problems.  We've done a little  exploration among  the  foreign central banks  in  the  last  few days  to  see what  the chances are  for  taking  the  curse  off  a further movement  [down in interest  rates].  If  [such  a move]  is  interpreted as  an  easing, whether  it's the  discount rate  or  something  else, what  are  the prospects  that  this would be hidden or  submerged  in other  rate changes?  The  answer, I think,  is  ambiguous  at  the  least.  It's another dimension  that  can be  thrown in here.  It  is  not  an irrelevant consideration  in  the  framework  of  the  next week or  so because  I can't say there  is  no possibility.  If  it  doesn't  happen pretty  soon,  I think  [our  foreign  colleagues]  will  all  go  away on vacation and  it probably won't happen until  September.  But  it  is  a matter that  is under consideration  in a number  of  countries--so  far with a negative answer.  The  situation  is  such that  if  one  country moved, everybody probably would move;  but nobody wants  to  lead the  parade."], [585, "No.  I think we're irrelevant  to  this.  We're  not totally  irrelevant,  but  they consider us  off  on a course  of our own  and somewhat  irresponsible  anyway.  Whether we move or not doesn't have  the  same bearing as  somebody important within  Europe moving,  or  even  if  the  Japanese move.  I don't think  there's much chance  of  the  Japanese  leading the  parade,  although  they might."], [587, "There  are all  sorts  of  conflicts  involved. They are  in the  same dilemma  as we  are basically.  They'd like  to move  \fin  terms  of  the  business outlook  but  they don't want  to  give  any sense to  their  own public,  externally  or internally,  that  they've given up on inflation.  They're very  sensitive  to  that.  And the  Germans  are  in a peculiar position because  they're at  the bottom of  the EMS  exchange rate  [band].  weak in their terms.  The currency that  is  strong  in  the EMS  is  the French  franc.  The  trouble with  the French  [making a move]  is  that they have  a rising inflation rate  at  the  moment.  They're  about  the only country  left where  inflation  is  still  rising.  And while  they have a sluggish business  situation, they  also  say:  How can we give  a signal  about  inflation when the  inflation  rate  is  still  rising?

Now,  [the  interval before]  the  next meeting  is  so  short  that I really  can't conceive  of  these numbers  getting  to  the point where we'd want  to  exert  very strong restraint,  but I suppose  they could. To  try  to be  specific,  suppose we got  a fairly big July--significantly bigger  than  this  [projection]--and we were  coming  into August,  but [before  the]  meeting, and the August  projection was  for  a 12  percent increase.  I suppose we'd let  the  federal  funds  rate begin  to go  up and we wouldn't fully adjust  the path to  take  care  of  a 12  percent increase,  say, on  top of  a 10  percent  increase--just  to pick two numbers  out  of  the  air."], [610, "I think we'd probably accept  9 percent--  I'm just  giving a qualitative  judgment--provided the  federal  funds rate  is  behaving  as  expected.

We will  anyway, I think, with the escape hatch, but  it  would be moderated.

If  you don't want  to  bias  it  in  that direction  and feel  strongly  that you want  a much more neutral  statement,  vote against  it.  And  if  asked whether this was  unanimous,  I'd  say  \"no;\"  some  people were  doubtful and  enough doubtful  that we were going to  make progress  in  that  direction next year  that  they wanted  to  allow  themselves,  in effect,  a bigger  escape hatch.

My overall  impression  is  that,  for  some reason, not  voting may breed  irresponsibility or  something.  But  the ranges are very similar  and fall within  the  range  of  the  Board staff's projections  for  the major variables  in  both  '80  and  '81.  There were  a couple  of  outliers  among  the  non-voting Presidents.  We  are not committed  to  any particular  treatment  of  this  in the  report.  What we did in  the  last  two reports,  I believe,  was  to  show  a range  for  Board members.  I was  asked  the  last  time why we  didn't  include all Committee members.  I didn't  commit myself  [to  a change],  but  I acknowledged  that  that was  a reasonable question.  So  my presumption is  that  we might  as  well  show  the range  for all  Committee members  this time.  I'm not  sure  there's  any particular point in  dividing  it  up between Board members  and others.  We  could include  non-voting Presidents  or  not,  but  the  specific  request was  \"Committee members\"  so my  [suggestion]  would be  to  combine  the Board members  and the Presidents  and say  this  is  the  Committee's range.  We've  never  tried to  narrow  the  range very  far.  We've  had among  the Board members  some discussion of  whether  the more  outlying  [views]  couldn't converge someplace.  There were some  problems  that  arose when we discussed  this among  the Board, which relate  to  the  problem that  Chuck just  raised, and I think we ought  to  discuss  this  a bit.  We decided on  the  ranges.  \fWe're a  little vague  about  next year, but we  have  to  discuss  their consistency with  the  forecast  of  the  Council  [of  Economic  Advisors] Mr. Kichline  says  on  the  basis  of  his  scientific  investigation that they are  consistent, with  a low  order  of  probability.

I am afraid,  frankly,  of  just  presenting  a projection which  says  \"with a tax  cut\"  because I don't  know how  to  avoid  the  implication that  the Federal  Reserve takes  it  for  granted that  there will  be a tax  cut  and that  it's  desirable.  The  only  argument  against  presenting  it  at  least both ways  is  that  the  numbers  look  so  sour without  [a  tax cut].

We have  to  fight  Proxmire all  the  time anyway because he  is  always  trying to  get  us  to  narrow the  ranges;  and at  some point  that  is  going to give  us problems.  I think we  should try  to  hold out  for  somewhat broader ranges."], [334, "Except  that  it  is  in  the wrong direction."], [382, "Well, my point of  view is  strongly driven by something that we  haven't  talked  about yet,  and that  is  that we  are still  kind of  on  a honeymoon and that  the  tough times are  ahead.  The technique  that we  are using  implies  that at  some point  in  time, when the  economy begins  to  strengthen, unemployment will  still  be high and probably rising and  interest rates will begin  to go up.  And that  is  \fwhen  the moment of  truth will  arise.  That  is  the period  that  Governor Wallich  is  afraid of  in  that he  thinks  it  will put  us  in  the  cowardly camp.  I don't believe  that's  correct.  But  it  is  important  that we follow a strategy that  gives us  the best  opportunity  to  stick  to our guns  in  spite of  what may be at  that point  considerably more pressure than we  are  presently feeling.  Therefore, my approach would be  to hold  to  the present  targets and to  ease  toward  them reasonably slowly, which would mean aiming  to  reach them  in December.  I would not  like to  see us  [promote  rapid growth]  to  reach them  in September, which would mean that  the  fourth quarter would be  the period in which we will  start  to  see  interest  rates  rising  rapidly.  It would put us  in that box quickly.  For 1981  I believe the  4-1/2 percent  figure  is  sufficiently  restrictive  for us  to  be using in  our  thinking at  this  time.  However, it's very important  that we give  ourselves  as much leeway as we can. I would  like  to  suggest  that  for  1981 we  comment along  the  lines  that the  aggregates will be  generally at  or  below the present  targets.  We are  all  very uncertain about  the  state of  the economy.  We  all recognize how difficult  forecasting  is  currently and it  would not  help us much at  this  point to  be specific.  I would like  to  see us  have  the opportunity to have  a little more running  room at  the  end of  the year. So  far  as  the  bank credit  figures  are  concerned, I don't  think they are very critical.  The  monetary aggregates  are much more  important. I certainly would not be  opposed  to Governor Teeters's  approach that we  say  [bank  credit]  is  running below the  target  range but that's because  of  a shift  in  the  type  of  debt  [being used]  or  something  like that.  So  far as wage and price  guidelines  are  concerned, I don't  think they make much difference  at  this  point.  There  is  a possibility that somewhere down the  road  they may make  some  difference.  There  is something  to be  said about  rational  expectations  in  terms  of  getting inflation down over  time  and, although we  can't have  a social  contract like  they have  in other countries,  I believe  that  some wage-price guidelines  together with a variety of  other things  can make a difference.  As  far  as  the  tax  cut  is  concerned, I favor  one;  I favor a tax  cut  that will  help on inflation  and help  in  terms  of  savings  and productivity.  Therefore,  I would agree that we  ought  to  do something about depreciation  or  investment  tax  credits  or  something  in that area.  I agree the  timing would be much better if  it  could be put  off until  next year.

On wage-price policy, the way wages  and prices behave in a complex modern economy  leaves really no alternative but  to  try to  use voluntary guidelines  to supplement monetary and fiscal  policies.  I wish I could agree with Governor Wallich  that a TIP would work, but I don't  see  any kind  of TIP that  is  feasible.  \fSo  far  as  the  targets  are concerned, I want to  start with  1981  and work backwards.  If  I have understood correctly, the  staff  is saying  that  if  we want  to keep  the unemployment  rate  from going up further,  from roughly 9 percent at  the  end of  1980,  we are  going to have  to  provide for  an increase  in Ml,  however defined--not worrying for  the moment about NOW accounts and so  on--of  roughly 7 percent unless we have a very  favorable shift  in money demand.  And Steve  is saying  that  the  chances  of not  getting that  favorable  shift  in money demand are not  trivial.  I would say  that,  indeed,  they are not trivial;  it  may not happen at  all.  So  I think it would be  a serious mistake  for us  to  decide  at this  juncture that we ought to  lower  the target growth rates  for the  narrow monetary aggregates for  next year. I'm more pessimistic  than the  staff  on  the outlook for  inflation next year.  But we can't possibly run a viable  long-run monetary strategy to  reduce  inflation if we follow  a strategy that pushes  the unemployment rate well  above  9 percent.  I just  don't  think  that's viable.  Now, the  logic  of  my position  for 1980  and my interpretation of what has  been happening recently says  we  ought  to  lower  the growth ranges;  substantively I agree with Governor Wallich  completely.  But  I don't  think we  can lower  them now for the  rest  of  1980 and  then raise them for  1981.  So,  I would be  inclined to  leave  the  targets where they are  for 1980;  but  I would be entirely happy, unless we  have  a reverse  shift of  the money demand function, to  see  the actual  growth rate  of  the narrow monetary targets  fall below the  targets  for  this year.  I would be  quite prepared to  explain to  the Congress  that when we have  a shift  in money demand to  pump out  enough money supply to stay within  those  ranges is  murder.  It would just ruin  any chances we have  for  getting inflation under control  over the  long  run.  So  far  as M2  is  concerned, my feeling is  that we have  a range  that  looks inconsistent with the M-1A range  and that we  ought  to  be prepared to raise  that.  And if  we are reluctant  to raise the whole M2  range,  then I'd raise the upper end.  It  is  a new kind of aggregate."], [368, "1980.

The problem  is,  Larry,  that money and prices  do  not  track closely together.

And that might  spur  some additional  dollar  selling unless we  did it  on an  enormously massive  scale,  not  just  the  levels  that we  have before. On  the  other  hand, if  the  situation  gets  to  a point where  once  again we  have  to begin thinking  carefully of a package,  then along with  some monetary policy measures  it would be appropriate  and add to  the effectiveness--this  is  my own personal  feeling--to do  some  substantial gold selling.  And  in that  situation I think the  Congress would understand that.  We'd have  less  of  a political  problem also.

Substantively  I certainly agree with Lyle  Gramley and a lot of  others  that  the responsible  thing  to  say-- and I hope you will say  this,  Mr.  Chairman--is that  the  size and  the composition of  the  tax cut  should be  considered early in  the year. However,  I'd  like  to make  a point which I sometimes  think the American public doesn't  quite understand  [regarding]  why, if  everybody says  a tax cut  is  inevitable next year,  it  shouldn't be  legislated now.  So  I think you have  to point  out  two  factors:  One,  that  the  tax  cut and the  composition of  that  cut  can't  significantly affect  the  course  of the  economy for  the  rest  of  the  year;  and  secondly, if  you choose to, and you may not  choose  to,  that  the  politics  involved in  an election year are  not  conducive to  the  kind of  carefully studied and deliberately planned  tax cut  that  is  appropriate.  I also  feel  that wage-price  guidelines,  even though  they have  not  been very  effective  in the  last  two years,  are an  absolute essential.  I think it's  appropriate  to point  out  that  they worked in periods  during  the  '60s,  that  there  will be  an opportunity for whichever Administration  is  in power  to  start with a fresh slate,  and that  certainly  if  they can  be made much more effective they will  add both to  a better  recovery and higher  employment as  well as  a  lower inflation rate.  And they should go  hand-in-glove with  consideration of  the  tax-cut policy.  As  far  as  the aggregates go,  I also  share  the  overwhelming consensus  [developing]  here  that  we  should not  change  the aggregates for  1980.  But  I think it's  important  to  point  out  at  least  that we  \fexpect M-1A and M-1B to  come  in toward  the  lower  end of  their  ranges. If  we  don't say  that, we  may get  a very  adverse market  impact.  As  for  1981,  I am  similarly concerned about what  the market impact  will  be both  in domestic  markets--[that  is],  long-term market rates--and  the  foreign exchange markets  if  we  fail  to  say or  at  least to  imply that  there  will be  some  edging  down of  the  targets.  In a certain  sense,  it  has almost  become widely expected of  the  Federal Reserve.  I'm not disregarding the  substantive problem  that Nancy and Chuck pointed out,  and I realize  that  we  shouldn't  lock ourselves  into anything.  Certainly we  should not be  specific,  but I am a little concerned  about  the market  impact.  If we  were  to  fail  to  [say something  of  that  nature],  that would be  a noticeable omission,  and I would hope  that with your  usual  skill you will be  able  to  waffle.  I hope you will  bear  in mind  that we are  talking with one  eye  on  the market.  I guess  that pretty much summarizes  [my views]."], [410, "I think  that  captures  it  exactly."], [414, "One  possibility would be to  say  that  our presumption at  this  very early  stage  is  that  the Committee will wish  to  continue  its  long-run  fight  against  inflation  by some  gradual reduction of  the  aggregate  targets  but, given  the  uncertainties on all these  technical  aspects  such  as  the  shift  in  the demand  for money and a few other  things, we  feel  it's  definitely premature  to  come up with even tentative or  preliminary  [numbers]."], [458, "Do you  ever  formulate  the preliminary  targets  for  [the  year  ahead]  in relation  to  the  targets  rather  than the performance?"], [460, "That was my presumption until  I heard Bob's comments  just  now.  Of  the  two  choices  you've put  to  us--hope  to get  [growth]  down but  heavily qualified as  against being  neutral--I prefer  the  [former].  My  reason  is  that  if  it's  heavily and sufficiently qualified,  it's  not  a constraint  on our  flexibility  to  do what we  decide  later  on has  to be  done  in view of  the  situation  at that time.  But  I think  it will  come  as  a bit  of  a shock  to  the market if  we are neutral,  for  the  reasons  I  [mentioned]  earlier.

I think we have to  count  on  a high nominal GNP, quite  possibly a good rise  in real  GNP, and  an even higher  deflator than  either  the  Administration or  the  staff have.  The  latter is  based on  [our  past]  experience of always  tending to  underestimate  inflation.  We've  had a very patient labor  force.  Outside  the  strongly unionized  sectors wage increases have been very low, and one must  anticipate that  at  some  time  there will  be  a concerted push to  make up  for that.  We  also  have  to  bear in mind that,  in a sense,  our  staff  forecast  is a formal exercise based on an  assumption of  a given  rise  in  money supply.  And that  is interpreted optimistically with a 3 percent  [demand]  shift.  We  have never been  successful  in sticking by our money  supply targets  and I fear  that  the  same  thing will  happen again.  That  means  that we  have no  very clear ceiling  on the  up  side  and that  there's  a real possibility of  going  to higher rates  of  inflation  and much higher rates  of  nominal GNP  than  any of  this  says.  Well,  let  me  just ask one  small  technical  question.  Jerry,  you were  skeptical  about business  fixed investment  spending, partly on the  grounds  of  low capacity utilization.  Isn't  there  a chance  that we are  once  more overestimating  our  true  capacity, as  I think we  did the last  time  round, and  that  the pressure begins at  lower  capacity use levels?  And secondly, given the high  increases  in wages  that  firms [already have  implemented]  and that  seem ahead,  isn't  it  possible that they may put more  emphasis  on modernization  than expansion?"], [344, "Well,  I feel  we ought  to  reduce  the  ranges  for  1980.  I realize  it  looks  a little  like base drift  in  fitting  the goals  to  suit  the  achievements,  but  the  alternative of bringing the achievements  back within the  ranges  that were our  goals  could be very damaging.  That would mean  a rapid  [rate  of]  increase  in  the aggregates.  We'd have  to  go  for  a number of months  at  rates  of  growth in M-1A, and M-1B even more  so,  that  in the  past have been regarded as indicating  inflation and perhaps  a reversal  of  our policy.  We would have  to  drive  interest  rates down  somewhat  further to  severely negative rates.  And then we would  have to make  a turnabout at  some point  in  order  to  get back on track;  [with money growth]  having sharply risen back to track, we'd have  to  slow it  down,  thereby suddenly raising  interest  rates  after  [previously]  having driven  them down.  I think all  these gyrations  would be  damaging, and we are not likely  to do  them  [when needed].  We will  find ourselves missing or somehow avoiding the very painful  issues  involved in  these  interest rate movements.  So  I would favor bringing down the  M-1A and M-1B ranges  1/2 point  for  1980.  For  the next year  I share  the philosophy that  we ought  to  announce a reduction.  I am very apprehensive  that we will  be  far out of  reach with regard  to  the  development of  nominal  income  on one  side and the reduced monetary aggregates  targets  are  concerned.  I see  the additional problem of M-1B.  I, too,  would be  surprised if  there weren't  a more rapid switch  [to  NOW accounts],  causing M-1B to increase more  rapidly and M-1A to  slow.  It  looks  as  though M-1A  is really a diminished, vanishing species as  far as  most people are concerned.  And  I think perhaps Frank Morris'  suggestion of  focusing on M2  and M3  for  '81  and explaining  that  under  these conditions  we cannot be very  specific  about M-1A and M-1B  is  a way out.  We would do what we  should do--indicate  a reduction;  that  is  what I would recommend.

I'd also point out  to you that  I don't think there  is  an  overwhelming need  to  change the bank credit number because we know there  has  been a tremendous substitution of  commercial paper  for bank credit.  And if we  take [account of]  the  total  sources  of  credit  in  [that measure],  then the  6 to  9 percent  range is  one that  is  achievable.

So, we  could just  explain  \fthat  there has been a shift  in  the way the market  is  [behaving]  and keep the  same range.  For next year, I really  am disturbed that  everybody wants  to  lower  [the  ranges].  Have  you not  looked at what  the  federal  funds rate would be if  we  lower  them?  The  funds  rate in  the  fourth quarter of  1981,  if  we  lower our  targets,  would be  15  percent.  How much mortgage  activity do  you expect  to have  if  fed  funds  are at  15 percent?  There's  a limit  to how far  we  can push down  on money growth and not  just absolutely strangle  this  economy.  And given the uncertainties  of  the outlook  at  this  point,  I think the  safest  thing to do  is  to  say that we  are going  to  stay within  the same ranges  next year.  We have wide enough  ranges  to  lower the  actual  outcome,  to  come in at  the  low end.  But  to  set  out  now to  push short-term rates  up to the 15  percent area  seems  to me  outrageous,  frankly.  It  would almost completely negate  any real  growth that we are  going  to get  over this period.  The housing market  certainly won't  come back.  The  thing to do  is  to  say that we will  aim to  get within the  ranges and that we aren't  sure we  are going  to  hit  the midpoint  of  every one of  them. I'd stick to  the  bank credit range as modified, and then  say at  this point  that we  simply plan  to continue  [those  ranges]  through next year rather  than that  our  total  task  in  life  is  to reduce  the  rate of increase  in  the money supply year after year.

That has  a direct  impact  on wages.  They can take  out  the  increase  in January and dress  it up  as  a removal  of  health insurance  [unintelligible].

There's less  feedback effect  on the  rest  of  the world, with probably two important  exceptions.  One  is  Canada, which had negative growth in  the first  quarter--2  percent  at  an annual  rate.

That's what I'm asking."], [248, "I understand that.  But  looking at  the  factors  of  costs  and prices,  is  it  better productivity?"], [250, "Well, not  [until]  next year,  though."], [279, "I'm fairly  comfortable with  the  forecast.  I have  a feeling that  the  staff might be on  the  optimistic  side with regard  to prices.  I noticed that  food price increases  are  really nothing exceptional  at  all  in  this  forecast and  intuitively I would  \fhave  expected a considerable burst  in  food prices  later this year and early next year as  animal  inventories  are reduced and can't  go  any lower and we get  a very  substantial reaction in meat prices.  I also agree with Lyle  that  the  pressures  on  compensation are all  going  to be on  the up  side of  this  forecast  rather  than the  low side.  And  then I'm not really sure  about  energy;  that's  a wild card.  [The  staff  has] a 16  percent  increase year-end to year-end, which is  fairly modest;  on the other hand, one  could make a case  that  a surplus would make even that  a rather  large  increase.  I'm just  not  sure  about  that.  If we did have a little more  in prices,  we might  have a little  less  real growth, given the  policy assumptions.  And that  would be  the  tendency, I think, as  the year goes  on.  In  addition, there is  no allowance here for  shocks.  One  can't  have  an allowance  for  shocks,  but  in  fact many of  the main features  of  our  economy in  the  last  few years  have been conditioned by unanticipated shocks.  And  there  could be more  in the future--the  large  country difficulties,  large  company difficulties, large bank difficulties, whatever  they might be--that could adversely affect  the outlook.  As  far as  the money number  is  concerned, I think  assuming  that  3 percent demand shift  is  a very conservative  stance for  the staff  to  take.  Remember what  that means.  If  the  demand shift  were less  than 3 percent, interest rates would be higher  than  forecast given GNP;  and they're  already forecast  to  be  pretty high.  Back  in '75  we  didn't put  in much demand  shift,  and we  [forecast]  very high interest rates rather early on in  the  recovery,  [and  those  rates] never materialized.  So  I think taking a sort of  midpoint figure  for  a continued demand  shift  is  conservative  and the  proper way to  go.  If it's  [more]  than this,  we'll have  credit  conditions  that  are  a little easier  than  forecast.  But given  the  great uncertainty in this  area-- and I don't understand the  thing nor do  I think  the model  is  much good--the  staff  assumption seems  proper and conservative.  And we ought  to  keep that  in mind."], [303, "And M3  will be  just  a little below the midpoint."], [308, "After having run  for a year  or more above  the  top of  the  range.  It  does  suggest that we  could reduce  the M-1A range on  technical  grounds;  I guess  one could justify  a half point reduction in the  lower  end."], [310, "I mentioned the  lower end  of  the  range.  Your  point about  the  top end is  very well  taken."], [347, "Last  gasp."], [371, "Or  let  it  go  a little  over."], [373, "Chances  are  that M3 will  be  within  [its  range]  and we  could be  a little  over on M2  and a little under  on Ml."], [384, "I agree  100  percent with Nancy.  I would use  the  same  ranges again, recognizing  that  for  1980  we  expect--and to  some extent plan--to  come  in  at  the bottom end of  the  range on M1  and maybe well  up  in  the range on  M2.  I think  that's probably better than making  any kind  of  technical  adjustment.  And I agree  that we  can explain bank  credit by emphasizing  [commercial]  paper,  the way Nancy did, rather than  corporate debt  generally because people understand that paper  is  a direct  substitute  for bank borrowing,  depending on rate  relationships.  For  1981,  I agree with both Nancy and Lyle.  I don't  see  any  chance  of  reducing these ranges  without possibly having considerable impacts  on the  economy.  Now, a number  of people have  said they don't  \fknow what  to  do with M1,  so  let's  reduce  M2.  But M2,  as  somebody pointed out  earlier,  is  a source  of housing  credit  in  substantial  part and has  the money market mutual  funds  in  it,  which are  still  growing pretty rapidly.  The  top end of  our  range now is  9 percent.  We can't ignore  the  fact  that nominal  GNP  is  going to have  to  go  up quite  a bit because, much as we  dislike it,  there's going to be  quite  a lot  of inflation.  And  [reducing the  M2  range]  isn't  the way to  stop that inflation.  Therefore,  it  seems  to me  that we'll be  lucky if  we can keep M2  within that  9 percent  [upper  limit]  next year.  The  strategy I would follow would be  to  say  that  1981  is  a long  time  off but  we anticipate having something  like  the same  kinds of  ranges  for  1981 that we have had  this year  and we would hope to  reduce growth within these  ranges  as  inflationary pressures abate--assuming  they do.  You can make  that comment:  We will  do  it  as  we are  able to  do it,  as inflationary pressures  are reduced.  On wage-price  control,  I would get  rid of  that program  as soon as  possible.  I think it  is  totally discredited in the  country and  it  is  best to  get  rid of  [that  bureaucracy]  and  let  it  rest  for  a year or  two and maybe  try something better next  time.  We  can say  that market  forces are  going to  lead toward more moderate settlements  in labor  [contracts]  later.  One  of  the difficulties in  continuing the program is  that we  have to  recognize  the  cost  of  living.  And if we do,  that's  going to  lead us  as  it  did this year  to  raise  the Reserve Bank budgets  rather  than reduce them.  The change  in the wage-price guidelines  led us  to  increase Reserve  Bank  salaries and  that's  a very fine example  of  a counterproductive  effect  from  that  [program].  It's our  own salaries  that have  to be  limited--not somebody else's,  but everybody's  in this  room.  I don't  see  any sense  in arguing  the tax  issue.  There will  be a reduction next  year.  It  needs  to  include  some  consumption tax reduction because consumers  are too  hard pressed, but  I like  the  idea of  making  it  a payroll  rather  than a general  income tax reduction."], [389, "Perhaps  we could invent  a typo  for  this and  scramble the  sentence--"], [394, "That's what everybody  always does  when they  talk  about  their  own salary."], [408, "It's  going  to  have  to."], [421, "It's  in  the  longer-term paragraph,  isn't  it?"], [425, "I thought  that's  what  the  Humphrey-Hawkins Act  called  for."], [427, "And  of  the need  to  keep  some  of  our  [citizens]  employed."], [435, "[Unintelligible]  talk about  ranges.

But  in apartments and  the whole  commercial area,  one  can't beg, borrow, or  steal  space.

At least  the builders  and the people  in  the  financing  area  are  talking about a fairly sharp  turnaround,  Paul.  So  that's  a positive.  Second, if  one  looks  at  these  declines, how much is  psychological  and how much is  real  in  terms  of  the  shock  effect that we had?  And to what  extent can we have  factors  that will  go  the other way?  For  example, my guess is  that while the  1972  to  1979  budget  experience  indicates  that expenditures  fell  short  [of  the estimates],  I have greater  confidence in the  Administration this year  so  I think  that may not be  the  case. We  may get  a bigger  deficit  in 1980  than has been projected, [particularly]  if we get  the  tax cut--and at  least  the discussions  of that  seem real.  And perhaps people  are not being  sophisticated in their analysis  and are  simply  taking the present  deficit and then adding on  the  tax cut,  whatever that  may be.  You talked about  a deficit  in the  area  of  $110  billion  for  next year.  In  that environment what kind of  reaction will we get  in  terms of  peoples' behavior?  Third,  [in  the area  of  prices]  I realize  the animal  problem gives  one pause but,  on  the other  hand, the  grain prospects  look  quite good.  So  I don't know to what  extent we  might get  a stand-off  on the food side.  Psychologically we have  the problem  that gasoline is  about to  run out  our ears  in terms  of  storage.  What  happens  if we  start  to cut gasoline  prices?  I realize  the  Saudis  and others  are talking about raising  [prices  for]  crude, but what  kind of  psychological impact will  we get  from  that  kind of  development  and from  the  scare [tactics]--the  \"look what  lies ahead with $110  billion  deficits\"  and that  kind of  talk?  Will we  again get  some psychological  reactions?  We have  talked about  the  shift  in demand  for money and so  forth.  But when we  look at  these  capital  ratios, have we made allowance  for  that  shift  in  terms  of how they  will behave, even  though you've commented  on  the deterioration that has  occurred versus previous cycles?  So,  I'm trying  to  search for  things that  could give  \fus  a positive push at  this  time  rather  than  the more  negative kinds  of inputs  that we hear."], [376, "Mr. Chairman, my posture would be  to  emphasize  the  rapidity of  change we've  experienced and the  likelihood that  we may encounter  continued rapid changes down  the road.  I'd indicate  the kinds  of  changes  that have  taken place  and that  may take place  in  the future.  I would keep monetary policy unchanged but  stress  that maintaining  policy might  involve some  fluctuations  in  interest  rates ahead,  some  of  which may be adverse.  In view of  the  rapidity of change and  the many uncertainties, I would be  extremely hesitant  to  be very specific  about next year.  Inflation developments may go  one way or  the other  in the  fall, which may influence  [our decision].  We have the technological  changes with nationwide NOW accounts.  We  have  the uncertainty with respect  to  taxes  and a whole  set  of  [unintelligible]. So  I would be more  concerned  [about  making sure]  that policy is appropriate  with respect  to  the changed circumstances, whatever they might  be.  And I'd  say that  [ranges]  will be  announced in February, with  the  thought of  then  being very specific.  With respect  to  taxes,  I would be  inclined to  talk about  tax  reform, not  just  the  deficit  side of  the picture,  and to  stress  the importance of waiting  until there  is  a chance  to  consider those moves deliberately  rather than  hastily.  I am very sympathetic  to  the  social security tax problem--what  it  means  cost-wise,  income  return,  and all the  impacts--and the need to do  something on the  investment  incentive side.  That  may require  a cut  in expenditures,  depending  on the circumstances when  [the  Congress]  starts  to  consider this.  So  I think they are  caught  in  that.

Is  there  any impact on  fiscal policy in  terms  of what  we do  in  this period?

Then we might get a bigger  tax cut  than we'd otherwise  get.

I can report  that,  but  I don't have  any impression--"], [144, "I don't  see how it  could be  opposed."], [321, "Mr. Chairman,  as  to  the general  economic  and  psychological  setting,  I am persuaded that we  are  in a situation where our  conventional belief no  longer stands up  that monetary and  fiscal policy, if  handled appropriately, have  the  capacity  for nudging the economy along a path  toward  full  employment  and price  stability.  And I am persuaded  that we will  not be  able  to  achieve  those  desirable objectives without  engaging  in some  direct  interference  in  some  of  the  \fprice  and wage making processes.  But  even if  that's true,  it  seems  to me that  the best  contribution monetary policy  can make  is  to  behave  as if  that  were in  fact  the situation and hope that  somewhere  along  the way the  necessary  [steps]  will be  taken to  address  the  structural rigidities  in  the economy."], [323, "Well, turning  to what's  immediately at hand,  I  think it's  a close  call  as  to whether  to  make  any adjustments  in  the targets  that were  announced last February.  I can make  a  fairly persuasive  case  either way, I think.  It  seems  to  me  that we  are under rather  strong pressure  to  do something with the  6 to  9 percent range on bank credit.  Of course,  if we do  that,  then we have made  a change and  that  opens up  the whole set  of  ranges  for  other changes.  If  it were not  for that,  I would  come out  on balance  for no  change.  If  we were  to  come  out  [for no  change],  we could  just  incorporate  some words rationalizing that  any  time  we are  aiming at  a family of  targets, we obviously are not  going  to be able  to  hit  all  of  them.  And in this circumstance we  are  simply pursuing policies which, as  things  have developed, give greater priority to  the money measures than  to  the credit measures.  With respect  to next year, we have a choice  of  being either fairly specific or  quite general.  If we go  the route  of  being quite general, we should  reiterate with some  firmness  of  conviction, as already has  been suggested and as  we have  done previously,  that we  are of  a mind  to move to  lower  rates of  monetary growth until  such time  as we  get  to  that  level  of  growth which is  judged to  be consistent with full  employment under  conditions  of  price  stability.  But  as  next year has  the potential of  giving us  a fairly unusual  looking  set of numbers, until  such time as  we get  to  the point  of  presenting those numbers  it  might be appropriate now to  take  a little  time  to  elaborate on  the point  that  as  the  new legislation goes  into  effect,  we think it's  going  to have  a substantial  impact.  Just by way of  illustration, its impact  could be  such that  a posture  of moderate  slowing  in the rate  of  growth  of  our narrowest money measure might bring our  target for growth  of  that  particular measure down  to  zero.  So  I would want to  try to  get  across that  idea.  It  seems  to me  that  if  we  are going to  get much benefit  in  the  economy from monetary policy in this  next year  or  so,  it  has  to  flow pretty much from getting  across  the  idea that we  are  going  to impose  a policy that  will continue  to move  in  the direction of being  consistent with price stability, whatever  those numbers might be.

For next year, I disagree with most people who have  talked  so  far.  I think we ought  to  give  some  numbers  for next year.  If  we  fail  to  do  so,  we could  generate  some adverse psychology to  the effect  that the  Federal Reserve  is  not willing to  speak  except  in  very vague generalities.  On  \fthe  other hand, the problems of  setting ranges  for M1  numbers  for next year  are  really formidable.  I disagree with the  staff  recommendation that M-1B  should be boosted by only 1-1/2  percentage points  next  year; that's much too  low.  If  in  the  current  situation we are  getting  a boost  of  1-1/4  points to  M-1B  and then we  go  to  national NOW accounts, [the  effect will  be  greater].  The NOW account  is  a much more marketable concept than  the ATS  account;  furthermore  the  S&Ls,  since they do  not have demand deposits,  cannot  [offer]  ATS  accounts.  So  the 1-1/2  points  seems much  too  low.  Now,  if  we go with 2-1/2  points, which is  closer  to where  I think we are  going  to  come out,  then we will  get  some  very strange numbers.  For example,  for M-1A we will  get a range  of  -2 to  +1 percent and  for M-1B, 5-1/2  to  8 percent.  I just think our  ability to  set  ranges  for M-1A and M-1B next year  is  so limited that  we'd be much better off  simply telling  Congress  that,  due to  this new technology change  coming next  year, we  can't  do  a very good job at  estimating and, therefore,  we  are  only going  to  set  a target  for M2  next year.  Now, we  could add M3  to  that  and set  targets for M2  and M3.  And I would  say  for M2  that  we are going  to  scale down the range by  1/2  percentage point  to  5-1/2  to  8-1/2  percent.  If we are not willing to make any  commitment,  even a tentative  one,  on what we  are going to  do  in  '81--particularly if you are  [testifying]  at  a time when  the  foreign exchange markets  are very turbulent--we are likely to  get  adverse psychological  feedback.

A combination of  forces was operating  that  I'm afraid cannot  be exactly disassociated from one another."], [181, "It  is  very deeply related.  I think that's  absolutely correct."], [183, "We'd also  have a good deal  less  pressure  on unit labor  costs  and prices and presumably  the ability,  therefore,  to move into  a different  fiscal position as  well."], [185, "But what  we have  provides the basis  for  allowing  that,  I believe."], [196, "I think  it's  about  6 percent.

The  average hourly earnings  index  itself declines  between  '80  and  '81  by slightly more than  1 percent.  I don't have  a figure  for  the  fourth quarter  '81;  it would be  a bit more  than that,  though, as  opposed to  a compensation decline  over  that  same period  of  0.3.

The underlying wage  adjustment has  to  be  greater than the  compensation decline  that we show."], [270, "As  far  as  the  first point  is  concerned, it's  always  possible that we are  estimating capacity incorrectly.  But we have  tended to  scale down  the  effective  capacity level  in our  index by introducing a factor of  downtime that  is  much greater  than we had earlier.  So  I think we're  far more  realistic  in  terms of  effective capacity than we were,  let's  say,  6 years  ago.  As  far as  the  latter point  is  concerned,  certainly that  [possibility]  is  there.  The tendency  to  shift  toward capital because  of  the  [high]  relative price of  labor  versus capital  has  existed and continues  to  exist.  We have tried to  build that  in.  What  we've viewing  here  is  a cyclical performance rather  than the  longer-term secular considerations which really bear upon that  to  a greater degree.  We  also are  moving out  of a period in which pollution control  and related expenditures  have borne  such a heavy weight  relative  to  total  expenditures,  as  they did a few years ago.

My  staff's  forecast  is  close  to  that of  the Greenbook but  I personally feel  a little more pessimistic  just because I think we're coming  out,  I hope, of  a very wrenching inflationary experience,  which I believe  tends  to  lessen our  ability to  rely on  econometric models. And  I think some  of our past  sins,  so  to  speak,  in not encouraging enough  capital  formation and productivity  in  this  country are  catching up with us.  Maybe  I'm  just getting  older, but  this  causes me  to distrust  even more  than usual  the  figure  factory,  if  I may call  it that,  on the projections  for  1981.  So,  I'm just  a little more pessimistic personally.  I have  one  detail  question on  the unified budget.  You are  more optimistic  than the Administration for  fiscal  '80.  Following  up on  Lyle's point,  is  this  $55  to  $60  billion  [deficit  projected by  the  \fAdministration]  fairly set  at  this  point or  is  the  [potential] variation really more  than you've  indicated  here?

That's  part of  it?"], [239, "Yes,  for  1980,  the year we are  in right now."], [241, "This  is  also  minor, but do your projections for  '81  assume  that what  the Congress  is  trying to  do  on speeding up corporate  tax collection  [will  materialize]?"], [243, "Thank you."], [327, "Mr. Chairman,  I'm quite comfortable with  alternative  1 as  stated,  [namely to  maintain]  the present  ranges.  I would, of  course, do  the proposed  revision of  the bank credit range. But I don't  consider  that  in  the  same  box as  the  four  aggregates.  As a matter  of  fact,  I think we have  gone  out  of  our way to  make  it  clear to  the  [Congressional]  Committee--I'm relying  on memory here,  so someone can correct me  if  I am wrong--that  [our  aggregates  targets] would be  \"associated with\" bank  credit  expansion of  such and such. We've said that bank  credit  isn't  a target  in  the sense  that  the aggregates  are a target.  As  far  as  next year  is  concerned, I subscribe  also  to  the  idea of  [describing our  objectives] qualitatively.  I see  no reason though, Mr.  Chairman, why you  in your  testimony couldn't  indicate  that we are  at  a different point in  terms of  the  outlook for  the  ranges  for  this year--that  at this  time we are closer  to  the  low end of the  range  for M-1A and a little higher than the midpoint for M-1B, and so  forth.  You could do  it  qualitatively without disturbing your credibility;  I think  it would enhance your credibility.  And for  next year,  somewhat  differently  from Larry,  I would put  a little more reliance  on M2  because  I think it  is  a more stable aggregate against which to measure  than M-1A or M-1B.  We are going  to  have a lot  of volatility and unpredictability even  [though we're more  than]  a third of  the way through the  year.  So  I would  lean toward more  reliance  on M2  looking  forward.  It  isn't as  important in calendar year  '80,  but  I think  it  is  very important  in calendar year '81.  So,  I think you  can indicate qualitatively  [how]  we  are  leaning in our thinking without  getting into quantities and without disturbing credibility.  Fred Schultz's point  is  very apt  that  Proxmire would like nothing more than  to  see us  try to  fine-tune  some of  these ranges.

That's why we have M1.  I don't  see any harm in indicating  that we may not be  able  to reduce M2  but  that we expect  or hope to  have  slightly  lower M1  ranges.  I don't  think that would get you in too much trouble because M2  does  include  the  ingredients  of housing finance and  so  forth.

That's  the way I would lean.  I'd  say 7,  8,  and  8 percent--to the extent  that  we  like  point  targets  [for M-1A, M-1B, and  M2]  and we seem to  have gone  toward point  targets  in  the  short  run  for simplicity--as  long  as  we understand what we  are doing."], [552, "I don't want  to change  it."], [559, "I don't see  any problem  in  accepting the  8.7  percent  for July if  it  turns  out  that way."], [568, "I'd  round  them  off,  too.

The  fourth quarter of  1975,  one year  later, was  the  low point  [when  the year-to-year increase was  about]  4 percent.

There are alternative  explanations  of why productivity declined,  and one  could very easily suggest  that we may get a bigger rebound.  At  the  same  time,  on  the  compensation side we have  a situation where  real  wages have  declined for  a substantial period  of  time.  In  fact,  I would view it  the  other way around  on  the compensation  side:  We  think we have a good forecast  given  the assumptions.

It  tends  to  cut  several ways.  One of  the  arguments  is  that,  given the rising cost  of capital,  firms will  tend to  substitute more  labor  for  capital.  It depends  on  the  industry.  In  fact,  President Morris  had a conference at  the  Boston Fed  about  this whole  role  of  energy and productivity and capital  investment, and  it's  a cloudy area.  But  the balance  of thinking  is  probably that  energy prices  for many  firms  are  a relatively small  part of  total  costs.  So  it's hard to  sort  out where that will  fall;  one has  to  do  an awful  lot  of  disaggregated work.

And  I might  note  that  for  1980  and 1981  this  projection has a fairly dramatic  increase.

On the  receipts  side,  the Administration had  $519  billion as  an early number as  opposed  to  [our]  $523  billion.

I didn't go  into  this  in  the presentation, but  a good deal  of  the  difficulty revolves  around  the Administration's  [forecast  of]  13-3/4  percent  growth in nominal  GNP with  interest rates  not much higher than  they  are currently.  That tells you  something:  Really, their  implicit monetary  [growth] assumption has to be high.  So  the  exercise we've gone  through suggests  that  there's  a fairly wide range  [of  uncertainty]  associated with the point estimates  we've presented  for  the broad aggregates,  for 1981  in particular.

But  in  general we have built  in very restrictive monetary and  fiscal  policy assumptions  relative  to past  cyclical  experience.  At  the  same  time, on  the price  side  I feel reasonably comfortable.  I find  it  very difficult  to expect much greater price improvement next year, particularly in  light  of what  is happening on  energy;  and  food prices aren't  going to help.  Both of those were positive  forces  in  1975.  So  I feel  reasonably comfortable with  [our  forecast of]  both prices  and real  GNP.

I  have only  two questions.  One  has  to  try  to put monetary policy in  the context with  the thrust  of  fiscal policy, and  in  the  first  section  of your report you have  a table  on the  federal budget  and also  one on the high employment budget.  My question has  to  do  specifically with the high employment budget  assumptions.  We've had some  discussion  of  this before, Jerry,  as you  surely remember.  To  refresh my  recollection, what unemployment rate  are you assuming here?"], [198, "And  this uses  the  official  one?"], [201, "Well,  as  you know,  this  calculation  is  very  sensitive  to  differences  in  the unemployment  rate  assumption.

Maybe we  can  talk about  that  later."], [208, "If  I may, Mr.  Chairman,  I have one more  question.  It's  related  to  the  chart  entitled  \"Domestic Nonfinancial Sectors,\"  the  opening chart  in  the  fourth section.  I'm particularly interested  in the  reality  of  what will be  going on  in  financial markets  in  terms  of  federal  borrowing,  broadly defined.  The red bars on the  chart  show  federal borrowings.  Did I understand you to  say that  that  is  on  the unified budget  basis?  In  other words, what  I'm trying  to get  at  is:  Does  it  include  that very  large  and  growing amount  of  off-budget activities--the mortgage pool,  the  government sponsored enterprises,  and what  have you?"], [213, "It  does  include  the  off-budget?"], [216, "How much bigger would the  number be  if  you  included the  so-called privately  owned, government-sponsored enterprises  and the mortgage  pools?

If  at  some  future  date  the  Congress goes  down  the road  that you  fear it  might  and begins  talking about setting  interest rate  levels,  we could  resist  that  kind of  resolution at  the appropriate  time.  To  resist the  current proposed resolution  I think would be  a mistake.  Such  a resolution would  strengthen  our hand in  terms of  not  following a usual  vigorous countercyclical  policy  in view of  the  ongoing very serious  nature  of  inflation."], [380, "Yes,  I think  that would be wise.  The dilemma  that you so well described earlier  is  going  to  come home to  roost, obviously, in  your testimony.  I agree  with a number of  other observations made  around the  table  a little  earlier  that  the markets, both domestic  and international, are  going  to be  extraordinarily sensitive  to  all  the  nuances of what  you have  to  say.  And  I think it is  quite  important  to  separate policymaking from public  perceptions  at this point because  the  impact  of  the  announced ranges  on  inflation psychology and what  is  assumed to  be  the  course of  actual  growth  is going to  be extraordinarily  important.  I certainly  agree  that we  \fought  to resist  any narrowing  of  those  ranges,  if  you get pushed  into speaking to  that  either in your testimony or in  response  to  questions. We  should try to  keep  the maximum flexibility because of  all  the changes  going on both in the economy and  in  financial  innovations; with nationwide NOW accounts  pending we  are going  to need  that flexibility  I am  sure.  You  asked us  to  speak about  assumptions  on tax  cuts  and wage- price policy.  I am pretty cynical  regarding  the ability of wage-price policy, if  it's  continued,  to do  anything realistic  to  change  the way the world runs.  If  I were a betting man, I'd bet  that  there  will  be  a tax cut  sometime  in  '81.  If we have  an  opportunity to  speak  to  how it ought  to be  structured, I would  certainly support  the  statements others  on the Committee have made  that we ought  to  aim for  tax reform designed  to  stimulate productivity and capital  investment  and take  the edge  off the  impact of  high and  rising payroll  taxes.  My own hunch  is that  there  is going  to be little,  if  any, real  restraint  on the  fiscal policy side  in  terms  of  the actual budget  or even  the  high employment budget.  That's because if  you look back at what happened  to  the unemployment  rate during  this period of  expansion that ended  last January, we  never even got  close to getting  down to  a 5.1  percent unemployment rate.  So  I think that  rate is  very unrealistic when calculating  the impact  of  a full  employment  budget.  That  leads me  to the  conclusion that monetary policy is  still  about  the  only game  in town  in  terms of  exerting  any anti-inflation effect.  But  we are  faced with the usual  dilemma that  there  is  a long  lag between  the  time we move  toward restraint and when it  shows  up  on  the price  front, which may not  be until  several years  from now.  Having wrestled with whether or not  to  change the  ranges,  I  think we would be well-advised just  to  keep  the present  ranges and not change  their width either.  There would be  too many problems  to explain  if we begin  tinkering with the  ranges  for  1980;  therefore,  I would  [support]  the views already  expressed not  to  fuss  with them. But,  of  course,  in terms  of policymaking  in  future months, we want to reserve  for ourselves  the  right  not  to  hit  the present midpoints  for all  the  reasons  that  have been set  forth.  With respect to  1981,  I would also  agree with the  view  expressed  earlier by many other  speakers  that we  should avoid getting overly  specific and try  to  avoid getting pinned down to  explicit numbers,  especially in view of  all  the  uncertainties  connected with the  impact  of  pending nationwide NOW accounts.  I favor keeping  [our targets  for]  1981  as  much as  possible in qualitative  terms  but  I hope on balance that your  testimony would imply,  if  not make explicitly plain,  that  in  terms of  longer-run strategy we  are still  working very hard at  getting the  inflation  rate down,  even  if  that  involves more aggregate  growth for next year  than we  may have  for  this  year.  That's about  all  I have  on  that."], [449, "Mr.  Chairman,  I would like  to  emphasize what  Governor Teeters  said.  There's  a real  trap  in  setting M2  targets  that we  think we  can achieve because, with these  new monetary instruments, we  can't.  As  Steve  just pointed out,  M2  is  loaded with  [components] over which we don't have  even  indirect  control--the money market funds,  overnight Eurodollars,  RPs,  and what have you.  I think  that's a real  snare  that we  ought  to be  very cautious  about."], [451, "Well, we  have a difference of  opinion.  That's  what makes horse  races  and stock markets."], [698, "It  depends  upon how many nuts  you  threw into  that waffle!"], [771, "Paul,  there's  another phrase  you might want  to  use  and  that  is:   \"It's  the present  intent  of  the  Committee...\""], [812, "Well,  it  is  an  opportunity, Mr.  Chairman, for  educating  the  [Congressional]  Committee about  the  long run."]], "MR BLACK": [[245, "Mr. Chairman, our differences with  the  staff  forecast have widened a bit  this  time.  For  1980,  we believe  that  the drop  in  real GNP will  probably be greater  than the  staff  is projecting.  This  concern stems mainly  from three  factors:  the growing  evidence that  the  international  situation may be weaker  than we've been assuming, the  conditions  in  the  construction industry--and specifically housing--and retail sales.  If you plot housing starts and retail  sales  in real  terms  opposite  similar periods  of  other postwar downturns,  this  time  they practically drop off  the  chart;  the drop  is  far greater  than anything we've had before.  And we don't believe  that  that  weakness has yet  spread to  other parts of  the  \feconomy to  the  extent  that  it  likely will.  So,  expecting  this greater weakness,  we think  the unemployment rate will  probably be higher by the  fourth quarter  than the  staff  is projecting,  though we  think the rise  in the  deflator will  be less.  We have  estimated  the  deflator at 8.5  percent versus  [the  staff's]  9.4  percent  for  the  four  quarters ending  in  the  final  quarter of  this  year.  And  in  1981,  more differences  [emerge]  because we  firmly believe  that  if we  stick  to  our targets on  the  aggregates,  as  I think we  will,  then  the  outcome will be much better  than the  staff  is  projecting.  We  are  guessing that we might have  an  increase  in  real  GNP  in the neighborhood of  6 percent  as compared to  the  2.5  percent  forecast by the  Board staff.  This would mean a good deal  less  inflation  and it  also  should mean less unemployment.  Our  forecast  is  a guess  too,  of  course, but we  feel [the  results  could be]  quite  different  from what the  staff has projected."], [247, "Well,  we keep the  money supply under better  control."], [249, "Yes,  I would  think so.  If  we make progress  on the  inflation  front,  I think people's  expectations  are  going  to  turn around very markedly.  And we have  [projected]  more private  investment than  has  been assumed, offering commensurate  increases  in productivity."], [342, "Mr. Chairman, like  several  of  the others who have spoken, our preference  for 1981  would be  the retention of  the existing ranges.  I come out pretty close to where Dave  Eastburn and Larry  Roos came out  but, of  course,  I wouldn't want to  overstate my case  as  you said Larry was  close  to doing.  So,  I feel pretty much the  same without  overstating  it.  Just  attribute  [the  overstatement]  to  him! If  we  lower  our  targets now--and because of  where we are  I know  there is  a real  temptation  to do  that--people  are  going  to  interpret  it  as meaning that we have  just  forgiven our misses as  we have  done  in the past.  That's just  one  step  away  from their  concluding that  if  we overshoot  on  the up side  as  we come out  of  this--which is  where we usually have made our mistakes  in  the  past--we will  do  that just  as readily  [this  time].  So,  that  is  the  principal  reason I would stick with  these  targets.  But we  ought  to  recognize  that  there are  other aspects  of  credibility involved, and one  is  that  to  achieve these targets--to  get  anywhere near the  adjusted midpoints of  the ranges  for M-1A and M-1B--we have  to have pretty darn rapid rates  of  growth  in those  aggregates between now and  the end  of  the year.  And I'm convinced that  a substantial body of  the  financial  public is  apt  to conclude  that we have  thrown  in the  towel  [on  fighting  inflation] unless  we  do a very good job of  explaining  that.  I think you, Mr. Chairman, and the  rest  of  us  will  have  to combat  that  in  talks  if indeed we  do  decide  that  is  what we want  to pursue.  I am also  aware  that  this  course will probably weaken the  dollar  temporarily, but if  we don't go  ahead and move our  aggregates up  [into  the ranges],  the  intensification of  the  recession here will probably damage  our  trading partners  to  a considerable extent  and there will  be feedback  effects here.  And those  effects may even be more  serious  so  far as  domestic  activity is  concerned.  We  also ought to bear  in mind that  the real  way to  deal with the  foreign exchange problem  is to  deal with  inflation  rather than  to worry about  temporary differences  in  interest rates.  And I do  think  this policy will  be  the best way to  deal with inflation  over  the  long run.  So on  these grounds, we would  favor  approaching  the  adjusted midpoints--maybe I should say asymptotically or  rather slowly anyway--of  the  ranges  for M-1A and M-1B and we would weigh M-1B considerably more heavily  than the  others.  We  also would favor  shorter-run  specifications that  would be  consistent with that  kind of  long-run policy.  For  1981  I think it's  vital  that we  follow through and  announce  that we have  lowered our  targets,  as we  have been promising to  do  every time  we have  [testified].  I'd make  an effort  to  lower these  gradually, but  steadily.  I think Frank Morris made  a good point in  suggesting that we  ought  to  avoid saying much  about the  technical adjustments now.  I would favor  lowering all  of  the  ranges about  1/2  \fpercentage point but point  out  that we  will have  to make  adjustments later on.  I know that's  not going  to  eliminate  all  the  confusion that will  emanate  from this  statement, but  it  might reduce  it.  So  far as  the  last  question you asked,  I would not  favor a  tax cut  but  it  seems  inevitable given the political  situation, so  I am assuming that  one will  take  place.  And I agree with Frank Morris  that jawboning  is  practically useless.  I would say  it  might  have a marginally positive effect  if  monetary and fiscal  policy are doing what  they are  supposed  to  be  doing.  But  a tax cut  is  probably inevitable, so  I imagine we will  have  it  in  some  form."], [405, "I think he  understated his  case,  Mr.  Chairman!"], [407, "Mr. Chairman,  if  we  are  satisfied  that M-1B will  come  in  fairly low  in  its  range,  are we going to  be willing to  have it come  in  higher in  '81?"], [437, "If we have  the maximum shift  on M-1B of  5  percentage points, with a midpoint of  5-3/4  percent  the midpoint  could be  10-3/4  percent.  If  we have  the maximum  shift  on M-1A, the midpoint would be  1-1/2  percent."], [456, "Mr.  Chairman, could I make an  observation?  On M-  1B,  if  we  had known when we  set  these  long-run targets  that we would hit  the midpoint  or the  revised midpoint  of  5-3/4  percent,  I think we would have been reasonably happy with  that.  We  had  expansion of  M-1B in 1978  of  8.2  percent  and in  1979  of  7.6  percent.  And  if  we get  it down to  5-3/4 percent  [this  year],  that degree  of  deceleration seems plenty rapid to me.  If  we  do  that,  then  I don't have  any problem with decelerating further  in 1981.  But  if  it  comes  in at  2  or  3 percent  or something  like  that  [in  1980],  we have  a problem for  1981.  I would like to  see us  push that  [growth rate]  up toward  the midpoint  [while] we're  in  a  recession which I think  is  probably going  to be  as  serious or more  serious  than any postwar recession.  And then next  year,  I think we  can  do what  we said we would do."], [578, "That  suggests  to me,  Mr. Chairman,  that we ought  to  take  a look at  the  low end  of  that  funds rate  range.  We  may not be getting  the  shift  in demand  that we  thought;  we may have our  equations misspecified."], [602, "Steve, what  does  July  look  like?"], [666, "It's  easier  to  remember!"], [706, "All  I can  conclude  is  that  the  other members  of  that  subcommittee were more  influential  than the  two who are  here!"], [759, "Mr. Chairman, if  we don't  at  least hit  that  lower  part  of  the  ranges--and in  fact  if  we begin to  report month by month what the  market  is  apt  to perceive  as pretty rapid  [money growth] rates--I  think we will have  an extremely  severe credibility problem."], [761, "I'm saying  that during  the  next few months,  if  [money]  growth comes  anywhere near what we're projecting, as  we approach  the midpoint of  the  target range we're apt  to have a problem if we don't  explain  very carefully that we're  just  trying  to get growth back up within the  target  range.  If we  do  that  and then when Paul  testifies  he  doesn't  say  something about  a lower range  for  next year, we're going  to be  hit  by both sides  on  the credibility problem, I'm afraid.  I'd really want  to  emphasize  lower  [ranges]  if we  could possibly persuade  everybody to do  that."], [834, "They called us  outliers  and then  took our  [projections]  out  of  the  figures."]], "MR EASTBURN": [[252, "I was  interested  in the  estimates  of  uncertainties  accompanying the  forecast, which were based essentially on  a number of  simulations.

The thrust  of  your introductory comments  was that  [people]  behave differently these  days because of expectations  than  they would ordinarily."], [315, "Well,  I think  it's very true.  In  light of that,  it  seems  to me  that  this  exercise we go  through  twice a year goes beyond policymaking  so  far as  the  aggregates are  concerned and goes  to  the public  impact  in  terms  of  creditability and expectations. I would prefer your  statement  to  be  fairly  simple.  I'd  say,  first of all,  that we are  reaffirming the  anti-inflation stand  that we have been maintaining and,  consistent with that,  that  we  are going  to maintain the  targets  we had established for  1980.  I'd indicate the uncertainties involved in doing  that.  We  talked at  great length here about  the  shifts  and the  uncertainties involved in  the  shifts;  and if we are uncertain about  them,  [why]  talk about  that  publicly at  great length?  It  seems  to me  that would not enhance  our  credibility but would create  a great deal  of  public  confusion.  And I would not indulge  in a lot  of  fine-tuning among the various  averages.  That to me would even  further compound that problem.  So  for  1980  I would stick with what we  have;  I'd do any  qualitative explanations  necessary but leave  the  numbers where  they are.  I would confine  comments on 1981  to  a qualitative  statement  that we intend to pursue  our  long-term policy of  gradually reducing the rate  of  growth of  the money  supply without  being  specific about  the numbers  at  this  time."], [412, "I think you're entirely right.  It's not  easy. On the other hand, if you surround your discussion of  1980 with a good deal  of  qualitative  explanation  about  the uncertainties  regarding the shifts  in  demand  for money, and  so  forth--and  extend that  into  1981-- you will  have provided the background  for  a good deal  of  waffling."]], "MR RICE": [[272, "My question has  been answered."], [385, "I agree with  everybody.  It's  obvious  to me  that  there  is  going  to be  a tax cut  next year.  I just  hope  it's  a good one--that  is,  one  that  consists  in part  of  a reduction  in payroll taxes  but  also  increases  investment  incentives.  From my point  of  view it  should  have at  least  these  two  objectives:  To  increase investment incentives,  and hopefully have  the  effect  of  increasing productivity, and to  reduce the payroll  tax  burden.  I would also  add that  it's terribly  important  to get people  to  start  to  think in terms  of  tax reform as  soon as  possible.  This  is  separate, of  course,  from the immediate  tax  cut  issue  that  is  going  to  have  to be  dealt with.  But the  sooner we begin to  think  in  long-range  terms about  tax  reform, the better, because  it  has  all  kinds  of  implications  for productivity and stimulating investment,  and so  forth.  With respect to  wage-price policies,  I have  a good deal  of  sympathy  for Henry's  tax-based  incomes policy.  I don't  think there  is much chance  of  getting it,  but  I certainly would have  a good deal of sympathy  for it.  Absent a high probability of  getting  it,  I would probably find myself  agreeing with Governor  Partee  that we  should just forget  about  the wage-price  guidelines.  But,  again, I don't  know how politically realistic  that  is  at  the present time.  \fWith respect  to  the  aggregates,  I would  favor maintaining  the current  ranges  for  the  reasons  that  have  been given already.  I think the  credibility problem--I'm  speaking  now about 1980--is a real  one. We ought not be  in a position of  having  it  said  that  when the aggregates  move  in a way that's  uncomfortable  for us  we adjust  the ranges.  I don't  think we ought  to  tamper with  the ranges  for  1980. Therefore,  I would support  alternative  I, maintaining  the present ranges,  and not worry too much about where the  aggregates  come  in within  those ranges.  With respect  to  1981,  I would favor  strategy 1, again  for  reasons  that have  already been given.  We  ought  to  say that we  have  no reason at  this point  to  adjust  the  ranges  downward in  1981.  I hasten to  add that  six months  or  a year  from now, when we  are considering them again, we might well  want  to  adjust  the ranges.  But  I see no reason to  commit  ourselves now to  reducing the rate  of  growth  in  the aggregates.  To  do  so  would  run the  risk of  reducing  the  rates  of growth in money at  a time when unemployment  is  rising.  That  is  a realistic possibility, it  seems  to me,  and  I would not want  to  be  in a position of mechanically having  to  follow a policy which requires us to reduce  money growth at  a time when unemployment  is  still  rising. So  I would favor  stating  that we  see no  reason at  the present  time  to change  the  targets  for 1981;  however,  if  the situation unfolds  in  such a way six months  from now or a year  from now that  it  seems  necessary or  feasible, we will  certainly consider  it."], [401, "I don't understand  the  implications.

Perhaps  I should  begin by saying  that when Governor Partee  talks  about  Federal Reserve salaries  I would  take some  exception, but perhaps  I'll  save  that for another  forum."], [395, "With respect  to  the  longer-term targets  for  1980,  Mr. Chairman,  I think  the choice  is  a difficult one between maintaining  the  status  quo and lowering  them.  I have  some  sympathy for the view Governor Wallich  has  expressed, but  on balance  I would prefer to  see  the  targets remain unchanged for  1980.  Having  said that,  I do  think we ought  to  strive  to  come  in at  the lower  end and certainly not exceed  the midpoint  of  those ranges.  And we  should state  publicly that  we will  be  coming in  at  the  lower end  so as  to avoid  any market misinterpretation of  our ultimate motives.  With respect  to  1981, my present  feeling  is  that we should  probably reduce  the ranges,  but I think  it's premature  to be  very specific about  our  intentions  because  of  the uncertainties that everyone else has  [mentioned].  I think a tax  cut  is  inevitable  in  \f1981.  My own preference would be to  have  it  in  the form  of  tax reform and be  later  rather than  sooner, but  in  the  present political environment  I expect  a  tax cut  will  come  at  least  in  1981  if not sooner.  On wage and price policy, I don't  have much to  say  except that  I don't  think  that  policy has been very effective  and  the sooner we  dismantle  the bureaucracy  that's  administering those programs  the better off  we'll  be."]], "MR GAINOR": [[397, "With respect  to wages  and prices,  I agree  entirely with Bob  Forrestal  that  the  best thing we  could do  is dismantle  the  program as  soon as possible  and I'd recommend  that.

If we have  to have  it,  though, we'd like it  to  be deferred, preferably until  after the election.  With respect  to  1980,  we  favor  continuation  of  the  existing  ranges,  alternative  I.  I  think  that's  consistent  with what we  told Congress  and everyone  else earlier  in  the year and we  should follow through on  that  commitment.  As  to  1981,  we  favor  strategy  2, which supports  the  concept  of  an orderly reduction over  time  in  the  ranges that we're  aiming toward.  In deference to  the point  that  Ernie made about  legislative uncertainty and  so  on,  it's  probably better  to waffle on how we  state  our plans  for 1981  but  I definitely  think strategy 2  is  the  right  one."]], "MR CZERWINSKI": [[399, "Mr. Chairman,  there  is  little  that  I  can add  to  what has  already been  said.
