That's  a matter  of  interpretation."], [34, "I think the  Germans  have a mixed mind  about  this whole  thing.  They don't  like  the mark depreciating, but they at  least have  an argument as  to whether  intervention is  effective as  a means  of preventing  it  from appreciating.  There's  one  school  of thought  that  says:  Let  it  go up  so  it will  go  down further and  the market will  learn a lesson.  And I think that  school  of  thought has been prevalent.  But we have  been in  a position of rather  eagerly buying in  large part because  the  Treasury was  extremely anxious  to cover  its  losses.  They are also  anxious--I  think it's  a reasonable point  and this  is  a combined operation--to have  some  surplus  over  the coverage  of  their  [foreign currency denominated]  bonds  in case  the dollar goes  in  the  other direction.  They want  a cushion so  we will have some margin of  protection without making  them short.  And I suppose  from our standpoint,  a cushion seems  reasonable  too."], [36, "Well,  it's  a small  cushion now;  we  haven't  debated precisely how big  the  cushion might be."], [38, "That's  only part  of  the  story.  The other  part  is  that,  with the dollar  rising against  the  mark, a normal leaning against  the wind does  relieve pressures  on both us  and the Europeans  to  do  something  different  in domestic policy  than we  really want to  do.  So  the  two  things  have  to  some  degree coincided,  to  the extent  the  latter is  important.  I wouldn't put  a lot  of weight  on that  in  terms  of  affecting  interest  rate policy.  But to  the  extent  it affects  that,  it goes  in  [the  right]  direction.  So both of  those reasons  coincide  in  suggesting that  when the mark is weakening appreciably  some  intervention  seems  desirable."], [40, "I don't mind having a rising  currency to  some extent,  and it  has been rising.

I don't mean huge,  but our net [holdings]  are  only at  about  $200 million plus  now, right?"], [52, "They have been  substantially higher  than  that  in  the past  at  times  of--"], [58, "Yes."], [60, "Sure,  yes.  \f11/18/80"], [62, "In effect,  it  is washed  out as  another  operating  factor.

But you have to  ask what  those  people would do who  want to  get  into dollars otherwise,  and presumably those people are  getting  into  dollars  and buying some  securities.  They may not be Treasury securities,  but  in the  larger  scheme of  things  it  is  a wash in  our domestic market.  We are  getting a capital  inflow which we  would not  otherwise get."], [73, "No, because  otherwise  the  exchange  rate  would go up and presumably we would get  an  equilibrium in  the market and they would not buy  the  securities.

There  is  no question.  That  is because  Treasury securities  is  all  we  operate  in.

But  in terms  of  the general  supply and demand in  the money market  as  a whole,  it  is  probably a wash.  But  in a very direct  sense we sell  Treasury securities  to  the  extent we  buy marks."], [89, "I  don't know  if you want to  have  a  prolonged discussion today;  we  can do  it  next  time,  if  desirable.  The general  issue,  as  I understand  it,  is  concern about how much  [we should accumulate].  What  should be  the  guidelines  and all  the rest  \f11/18/80  and what should be  our net positive position  in  foreign currencies? There are really  two  questions.  There  is  that  question plus  under what  conditions does  it  make sense  to  intervene.  Now, we have  just been basically leaning  against  the  wind for  a variety of  reasons that have been mentioned.  We  now have--looking at  the  government as  a whole,  and  I think it  is  relevant  in  this particular case  because  the Treasury has been  looking at  our balances as  a hedge against  the Carter bonds  at  the moment--a  $200  million positive  position.  If there's real  concern about that  positive position and  about that getting  to  the  considerably bigger magnitudes  that we are  talking about and  if  interest  rates  stay high, then we have  an  immediate problem.  I frankly do  not  feel  that  concern.  I think  it  would be  a reasonable precaution to  hold amounts  within the  ranges we  are  now talking anyway--by which I mean  in the hundreds  of  millions  area.  I have no  real  problem with that;  I not  only have  no  real  problem, I think it  is  desirable for  the  reasons  that  have been suggested."], [101, "Yes,  that  is  probably  what we  ought  to do.  But  I would point  out,  just  in  terms  of this  general problem,  that we have  an  example  currently of  a  country that  is  taking  the extreme opposite  view, which  is  the United Kingdom,  and even  they have accumulated  some  reserves.  They have had  a very high  inflation  rate, high interest  rates,  and a prolonged and  very sizable appreciation  of sterling.  Whether  that  is  good or  bad is  the  question.  But  that  is an example  of  a  country  that  is  taking  a different view.  They have not taken  it  so extremely  that  they haven't  acquired  any foreign currencies;  they have.  But  they haven't  acquired very many."], [103, "I don't  think it  has  anything to  do with  their  fears  about  gains  or  losses  on foreign  exchange  transactions.

They will build  it  up  if we  don't.  It  is  very awkward for them to--"], [111, "It  is  in  fact very awkward for  them to  hold  [marks].  I don't have  any  disagreement with  the Treasury policy."], [113, "I accept  the  notion that  people  think  that is  true.  And I have  no reluctance  to  do  it.  I do  not myself  feel  the least bit  confused about what we are  doing, which apparently we have not  articulated correctly.  We are  leaning  somewhat  against  the appreciation of  the mark  and we  are willing  to  accumulate some balances  for  all  the precautionary reasons  that have been suggested. That's apart  from mostly in  the  past being  in  the position of  just getting back  into balance  as  the United  States and  that  phase at  the moment  is  over.  It  changed very rapidly a week ago  when we  suddenly got  into  a minus position after being  in a positive position for  a few days.  But  having reached that  arithmetic point,  I had presumed that we were willing to  acquire  some additional  foreign currencies consistent with our general  philosophy of being willing  to  lean against  the wind, anyway.

We will have  to  approve  them  formally at  some  stage.  There has been some limited consultation with  the  Congress by  the Treasury.  So  far as they are  concerned,  it  is  okay, but  I am not absolutely  clear in my mind that  there will be  no objections."], [145, "We had a consultation  on the House  side?"], [147, "It  looks as  if  it's  proceeding on  course,  subject  to  these  technical  [details]."], [149, "I understand."], [151, "I understand.

Our  earlier  decision  stands.  All  right, Mr.  Sternlight."], [175, "M-1B  startled me.  I don't know how there  came  to  be  such a difference between M-1A and M-1B,  $700  million  for M-1A and  $1.4  billion  for M-1B,  as  Peter said.  I was  just  looking  at these  data  and M-1B is  only  $100  million higher  than  it was  four weeks ago while M-1A  is  $500  million  lower than  it was  four weeks  ago.  Now, the  figure  four weeks  ago  had a little  spike, but we  haven't had a big increase  since  the  [October meeting].  We have  had two weeks  of decline  and then  this  week  of  increase which has about  balanced  off [the  declines].  I might  say on those money supply  figures  that  they don't  reflect  complete reporting;  they  reflect  reporting  for  all  the member banks and  the  sample of  nonmember  banks  that  we used before. When we complete  the  tabulation of  the nonmember  banks  that  we have not  been getting,  there may be a need  for  a benchmark revision, which would be  exactly analogous  to  the benchmark revisions  we have  been making every quarter anyway.  We  indicated  in  the  announcement  that that  might become  necessary.  There  is  no  reason  to  think  that  the benchmark revisions will  be any bigger  than  those we  have made  in  the past, but  it  is  going to  take  several more weeks,  I take  it,  to  get the  flow  of  data  from the  new reporters before  we  integrate  it.  We will  do  that  all  at  one  time  and  then  if  it  comes  out  different  from [the  estimates  based on]  the sample,  we will  announce  a benchmark revision."], [177, "I am not positive  of  that.  Mr Axilrod  is  a little  skeptical,  I guess.  We  expect  to  do  it  on Monday if  we don't do  it  on Friday.  But we  are  not  certain yet we  can do  it  on Friday. I might  say that  as  I understand  it,  the whole process  went quite smoothly.  People  seemed  to be reasonably  satisfied with the  data we have,  though we  don't have  all  the  new reporters.  Tell me,  Mr.  Beck, if  I am not  reflecting your views  and  other's  views  accurately.  We  do not yet have  the  data  from  the new reporters  but  the data  from  the old reporters  seem  to  be  in pretty good  shape,  and we  got  the  numbers together with a relatively  short  lag.  I think  that's  quite  a tribute to  the  efforts  throughout  the  System to  get  this done  in an orderly way.  And it  does  seem to  have gone quite  smoothly.  I know  it involved a  lot  of  hard work around  the  System generally."], [179, "What we  are going  to do?"], [181, "No,  there  is  a problem here  which you may  be referring  to  but  I can't  recite  it  all  exactly.  Steve, you can correct me,  but  I think  the main problem we  are  running  into  is  that we have a huge amount  of  excess reserves  now with  the new system."], [183, "It  is  all  this  vault  cash.  So,  what we  are  going  to  do  is  to put  an additional  line  on the  statement  that says  \"excess vault  cash\"  or  something  like  that.

Occasionally, we get  a jump because  they say,  in  effect:  We were hoping it  would come down and now we have  lost  hope.  And  that's pretty much  the way that we have  looked at  it,  too.  If  we have  these targets,  we really can't blame  them for  observing  [the  trend]  over  a period of  time."], [209, "Look, I am willing to  re-examine this  issue.  I don't  know how to  do  it  analytically.  My own  instinct,  as expressed by Fred Schultz,  is  that even  if  90 percent  of  the people  in the market agreed with us,  the  other  10  percent are going  to  raise  a ruckus  and there's  going to be  a big brouhaha.  We  can  look  at  the issues;  I don't  know how to  look at  them systematically, but we  can try."], [211, "Look, we would lose  something  [by  changing]  this.

I don't know if  it will  provide you with any reassurance or  not,  but  if  you think our M1 has  been unstable,  look  at  any  foreign country's M1  figure.  If you  look at  the  data over a period of  years, the  standard deviation  in  the United  States  is  about half  of  that  in other countries on  a monthly basis,  as  I recall  the numbers.  Even the annual numbers  don't look  any better;  they look worse.  Isn't  the characteristic  of all  these  series  that  M1  is  much more unstable than M2  and M3?"], [226, "Well,  let's  try  to do  it  later.  I don't  know what it  is  myself.

Let me make  only  two preliminary points.  First of  all,  the  story  isn't  in yet but  I will  anticipate the  story.  I don't  know what  is  going  to  happen to  long-term rates. I take  it  they are higher now, or not much changed anyway,  than before we changed  the discount rate."], [250, "It  appears that  the discount rate  change  has had an  impact  on  short-term rates.  I'd  just point  out  once  again that thoughts  that  a discount rate  change  is  a  \"freebie\" in adjusting to the market  are  not warranted  in  the particular  situation that we are  now in, when banks  are borrowing  very heavily.  The  use of  the surcharge  is  an attempt to  moderate  that reaction, but  just how much it will  moderate it  or whether  it will moderate it  at  all  is  not totally clear.  That's  the  general point  on  the paths.  Looking ahead, let me  say that  I would find  too  intense a discussion  on precisely where  the  target  is  in  the  short  run sterile--not  only  sterile, but possibly misleading--because  it  doesn't have much to  do with where we set  the path.  As  I indicated  last month, we've had repeated indications  in  the  past few months when the  figures  were coming  in high that  it made very little difference  where the  target was  set.  It made a lot  of  difference  as to how we  reacted to  the  deviation  from the  target,  right  or  wrong.  And that's precisely what  the  discussion ought  to  center on more profitably--whether  one  looks  at  it  in  terms of what  the borrowing  adjustments  in particular  should be  or,  as  some people may,  in  terms  of what  kind of  interest rate  changes  one  is willing to  tolerate  or permit.  Those  are  the  variables.  And  they have very  little to  do with whether  \"A,\"  \"B,\"  or  \"C\" is  chosen because the  actual  events  are  likely to  [vary]  over a much wider range, up or down, than is  indicated  [by  those alternatives].  The results  are unpredictable, and as  Steve just  said,  probably not much affected by what we do between now and the  end of  the  year because we simply don't have that  much time  to  affect  the aggregates.  So  we have  to  look at it with a view that  what we are  doing today may affect developments after  the  end of  the year.  I don't  see how one  can avoid  it.  So, with those preliminary  comments--"], [254, "That has  been the practice and  I would  presume  that  that  is  what  it will be,  yes."], [256, "Yes.  Consistent with past practices, if  we wanted to  adjust,  in effect,  we would put  the  target  lower and explain  that  as  the  reason why  the  target was lower.  I don't  know that  that's written in  concrete, but  that  is  the  implication of what we've done before  anyway.  It  is what  the Congress  is  used  to  and  it's what we  are used  to.  So  in a sense we  still have  a sliding base  on an annual  basis.  We no  longer have  it  on  a quarterly basis if  we continue  that  procedure.  We  could debate  that,  but that has  been  the presumption, anyway."], [258, "Yes,  I see no  reason  [why we couldn't]  do  it  that way--to  say we're still  targeting with an  older base--if the Committee  wanted.  We'd have  some confusion,  I think,  in  explaining ourselves.  But  if  that's what we wanted  to do  in substance,  it  is conceivable."], [261, "I don't  know.  I haven't  thought  about  that  question particularly.  I certainly haven't  thought  about a change  in procedures.  [Unintelligible]  there  is  something  to  say  if it  changed the procedure  despite  all  the very valid objections  you have.  If  it was  thought  terribly important  to  try  to make up  for  an overshoot,  instead of  just  having a target  that  sounded terribly low next year, we  might get  the  same  result  but  it would look a little different.  I literally had not  thought of  doing it  that way.  I think there would be  a horrendous problem  in  explaining precisely what we were  doing, but  it  may have  some merit."], [263, "We would have  to  change  the relationship  among them.

There  is  a fair amount  of  difference  of views  on some  of the  specifics  but  some  recognition on practically everybody's  part of some  common concerns,  too.  On approaches,  I would just  make two general points.  I think what we  are  seeing now  in  general  terms  is the  famous  collision between  the  recovery and monetary targets  that are  in some  sense too  restrictive  to permit  recovery unless  the momentum of  inflation declines.  I didn't  expect  to  reach  [this  stage] this  early, but here  it  is.  A number  of  people have  commented that these  targets,  just  to put  it  very quickly,  lower  the  limit on  the ability of  the  economy to  expand.  They are  going  to  continue to  do that,  I suspect,  given all  the uncertainties, with targets  of  the  type that we  have until  inflation  declines.  And that's  a very unsatisfactory picture  from any perspective, other  than sole-minded concern about hitting  the  targets.  That's where we  are and that's where we may be.  Somewhat  related to  that, which has  already been mentioned,  is  that we  still  have some  concern as  to how much fluctuation we  are generating  in the money supply figures  and  interest rates by not recognizing some  natural  instability  in  these data.  It's purely a matter  of  judgment and  it's  totally unsatisfactory in  terms  of reaching specific  decisions  because,  to  exaggerate  a bit, we  are guessing.  Let me  simply put  it  that  if we bend over backwards  to  hit a target  in  the  short  run and find ourselves not making  it,  we  end up with exactly  the  opposite problem in  a very limited period of  time  in terms  of  the  targets and with  some real  effects  on the  economy as  time  \fpasses.  And we have unnecessary fluctuations;  we may be  stuck with them  to  a degree but  they are not  a happy  circumstance  in which to operate.  But  that doesn't give us  precise guidance  on how to  balance those  considerations.  As  for hitting the  growth targets or not hitting  the  growth  targets--and  I can only give  you a personal view--I  am not  as concerned about  that as  some people  are because I don't  think,  as  I've said before, that  these  targets are written in heaven.  There  is  a lot of  uncertainty in  these  relationships.  I do  think we have  to demonstrate,  and I am  satisfied that  we have, that we  take them seriously.  That  is  important.  Whether  being precisely  in  the  ranges or  slightly  outside of  them is  terribly significant  to  credibility or not I think  depends  in  part upon our  own attitudes,  how we portray it, and how we  describe  the problems.  [To  the extent  that]  there  is  a recognition of the very real  problems  that  we have,  that credibility problem is  diminished.  If we  attach what  I personally think  is undue importance to  absolute precision, obviously the  public  is  also  going to  attach more  importance  to  absolute precision  than they  otherwise would.  In  that connection, I would only remind you that most  foreign countries use a range.  I believe  they  all do  now.  Is  there  one that doesn't, Mr. Truman?  I don't know.  There used  to  be."], [348, "The French have been pretty good on their  targets.  The Swiss  have  varied between growth in M1  of  23  percent one year to minus  3 percent  the next year  to  plus  4 percent  the  following year,  I think."], [350, "But  they have not  lost  their reputation  for prudence  and concern  in  the process."], [353, "Sure,  and that's  part  of  the  reason.  All I am saying  is  that  in part  the public's attitude  toward these  things depends upon our  general  behavior, not  the precise  arithmetic precision with which we reach  the  range.  Well,  that's  a philosophical comment.  We  have  to  reach a decision here.  So  far as  the money supply  targets  are  concerned, I sense  that we  are dealing with  two  somewhat  conflicting  concerns.  One, which I certainly recognize,  is  that we are  in  the middle of  the quarter.  If  we  were on the  schedule  that we  talked about before, this would be  the middle-of-the-quarter meeting.  We  would already  have set a quarterly growth target  and  the  inclination would be not  to  change that  unless  there was  something very persuasive  going on.  But we would consider whether  to  change  it  and how to  alter our operations. Certainly we  have been forced to  raise  that  target  repeatedly in recent months,  and one  can argue  that  for purely presentational purposes  it would be nice  to avoid a further  change in the  target.  I  \fthink there  is  a lot  to be  said for  that  view.  The consideration  on the other  side was  described by Governor Partee:  Is  that being realistic?  Is  anybody here  really proposing the  strength of  action and the  kind of  interest  rates  that  might be  necessary in our best judgment  to  reach alternative C--certainly  \"C\" but  even  \"B\"--which implies  from now on  [unintelligible].  Is  it  realistic  to  think  [we could achieve  the  target]?  I don't  doubt that  it  could happen, but given all  the uncertainty about  the normal  relationships  that  the staff gives  us, which  in  fact  are very erratic but are  all we  have to go  on--"], [355, "Well,  it  may be.  You can reconcile  yourself  to  that view and that's  all  right.  I don't think  the  staff would say  that  that would be  their best judgment."], [357, "Yes,  I know.  Anything is  possible  here!  I agree  it  is  possible."], [359, "Well, you could argue  that.  All  I am  saying  is  that  if  we took  the staff's median judgment  and reflected the distillation  of  assembled wisdom, recognizing that  there is  a huge range  of  uncertainty around it,  I think one would have  to  say  [it means]:  Let's really bang it  now.  One  could argue  that  that's  a good idea  because it's  going to  save  us a  lot of  problems in  the  future. On the other  hand, a lot  of  concern was  expressed that  really banging it  now is  just going  to  complicate  our problem in  the  very short  run. I think that  kind of  consideration would lead  one  in  substance  toward alternative  A.  If  I take  seriously what  I think I am hearing in comments we  have  had about  the  interest  rate range  and the borrowing assumptions  and all  the  rest--that people  don't want to  go  out  there and really bang  it--that  leaves me in  something of  a dilemma because I think  the Committee  is  in  something  of  a dilemma.  It  doesn't  exclude the possibility that we  could hit the  targets because we  just  don't know  these relationships well  enough.  And there is  the  argument  that it's better not to  change  things  and mislead anybody as  to  our real intentions.  I am not  sure,  but  I believe  the Committee members  are mostly between  \"A\" and  \"B.\"  I haven't counted and I am not  sure  they all  said precisely  [what  their preference was].  But  that pretty well describes  the  considerations.  We  are  somewhat artificially constrained because we  are  talking about  a period that  only has  six weeks more  to  run.  If  we were  not right  at  the  end of  the year--if we had looked at  it  from  the perspective  of  the  next  four months  instead of  the next  six weeks--and were  somewhat worried about how this  looks in  terms  of  the  targets  for  the year,  I don't  know whether people would  say something  like  \"A\" is  reasonable."], [361, "Well,  that's what  I am suggesting  in part. I would guess  that people might  say  \"A\" would be  all  right  if we  were looking through  the whole  first  quarter of  next year.  I don't  know whether  that's  true or  not, but  I--"], [363, "I don't know what you mean by your  comment.  I think what a lot  of  people  are worried  about, Willis,  is that by banging  it  really hard now, we're going  to  look foolishly low instead of  foolishly high in the beginning  of  the first  quarter or even in December.  Now, one may think  the  economy is  very strong--and I think  it  may have a little  [more]  momentum right  at  the moment  than the  staff  implies, but  I don't  doubt that  all the  risks  are  for a decline  in  the  time perspective  of  now  through the  end of  the  first quarter.  But we may find  the  fourth quarter numbers  are  a little higher than  the  staff  is  suggesting, which  further complicates  this dilemma.  We'll  see  just  where you want  to  go, but  I also  detected some concern about  the  interest  rate  level  expressed by a good many people.  Consistent with what we're doing,  I wouldn't  like to  get deliberately  in  an area where we have  to  work against an  interest  rate constraint because  that  changes  the  tone of  our actions,  but  the borrowings have  implications  for  that.  A $1.6  billion  level  of borrowings  or thereabouts has  been mentioned by a few people.  That's lower than  it  has  been, inadvertently or  not, most  recently.  That seems not  inappropriate  to me,  if we  don't want  to  put  a lot  of additional  pressure  on  the market  because we  just had  a discount  rate change.  And  in a sense,  by moving  the  initial borrowing assumption down slightly,  it  probably will  not  have much of  an  easing effect  on the market.  But  it prevents  the  discount rate move  from being amplified and reverberating through  the market excessively."], [365, "To be consistent with  \"A,\"  in effect."], [367, "If  your  conceptual  level of  borrowing  before  the discount  rate  action was  $1.6  billion, it  should be  lower now."], [371, "Well,  it  has  been running somewhat  higher  than  $1.6  billion.  What has  the  market  done  after your  operations this  morning,  Peter?  Where  is  the  federal  funds  rate?"], [373, "What did the  federal  funds  rate  do?"], [375, "But  you don't  know what has  happened since  then?"], [377, "I don't  know whether you're suggesting,  Steve,  that  consistent with what I and  other people were  trying  to  say in concept--I  lighted on  $1.6  billion as  a few people did--we  should really be  saying  $1.5  billion."], [380, "In a sense,  what a lot  of  people  seem to  be  talking  about is  that  they want to  keep  \"B\" for  the  reason suggested--that  they  don't want to  show  a further  change  in what we're aiming at.  But we  were talking  more about  the  specifications of  \"A\" with a higher federal  funds  rate  on the  low side of  its  range anyway. Let me just  get  reactions  to  this proposal:  The  \"B\" specifications and, taking account  of  Steve's  comment,  $1.5  billion or  thereabouts  on borrowing,  and 13  to  17  percent  for the  funds  rate, which a number of people mentioned for  that,  and a hope  that  they are  consistent  despite an  analysis  that  they might not  be.  Steve has  also suggested  the  idea--it  sounds  awfully  complicated but  it  just  is  complicated at  this  stage  of  the  game--of writing  something into  the directive  that we  are  looking toward the first  quarter,  in  effect.  We  could certainly write  it  into  the policy record, anyway.  We're  thinking of  \"B\" here  on how we  set  the reserve path  and would repeat  the  targets  that  we had  last  time, which are those  in  \"B.\"  And we'd put  in some phrase that  we recognize  that there  isn't much time between now and the  end of  the  year to  get on  a specific path.  But  we would  in a way reverse what we've said  [in  the past]  if  we  adopted  \"A;\"  we'd say  the  Committee thought  that  a small overshoot  would be  tolerable, provided that  growth in  the  aggregates  \fwas  at  a pace consistent  with more moderate growth next year.  I don't know whether that  language--"], [382, "The early months of  next year, yes.  Now,  what  that  leaves  out  is  that  some  overshoot  from the  specifications of \"B\" or any of  these alternatives,  if  it  developed, would be  tolerable in  the  short run without  our aggressively moving against  it.  I don't know how much you would work that  language  in,  Steve."], [384, "Well,  we have a conceptual  difficulty  there.  I am sure  that you are right,  but  sometimes those  same people said we  should not set  out now to  bang up  the borrowing level  and bang up interest rates.  That's  the  inconsistency with which we are dealing.  Verbally they may have  said  \"Don't tolerate an overshoot,\" but  they didn't  seem to be  supporting  the  strength of  action that would be  needed to  insure  against an  overshoot."], [386, "There  is  no question, growth  in  the  aggregates was  very high  in the  first  six weeks;  so  are  interest rates."], [388, "Steve  can correct me, but my  sense  of  it  is  that  if  we  started out  at  the borrowing  level  that we're  talking about  and  there were  no change  in  the money supply  from now on, week by week, we would come  out  very close  to  \"B,\"  wouldn't we, Steve?"], [390, "You only get  a $.3  billion drop  in  December with no  increase in  the weekly  figures  from here  on  out?

It gives you a rougher  \"right answer,\"  as  a matter  of  fact."], [398, "We're  having a consultation right  now.

Now, it's  an  extremely uncertain projection, and  I don't  attach a lot  of weight  to  it,  but  the experts  say that's  \fwhere we  are.  The  range of  uncertainty around it  is very wide.  The sense  of what  I have proposed, just  distilling  some  of  your comments, is  that  for  visual  reasons, which are not  unimportant, we will  stick with  \"B\" [for  the  ranges]  and hope growth comes  out  at  \"B,\"  but  act somewhat  like  \"A\" at  the moment.  That  leaves us with  the  question of how strongly we  react  if  \"A\" gets  confirmed or,  worse yet,  if  growth goes higher than the  specifications  of  \"A.\"  That's  the  sense  of  it  if we  adopt these  specifications;  and it's  reflected  in part  in  the federal  funds  range.  Obviously, we  have  to  consult  if we  hit  [the limit  on]  that."], [405, "I am not  sure what  it  implies  in  terms  of  [that  rate but]  there  is  a relationship.  What  it  implies  is  that we're pretty  slow about  changing  the nonborrowed path  to make  up  for any decline in borrowing.  That's what  it  specifically implies,  which in turn slows  down any decline  in the  funds  rate."], [407, "It would come down  some  if we had a really  big shortfall, but--"], [412, "I think  it's  clear  that people  in general  terms  are willing  to  [tolerate]  some  shortfall  from whatever target we adopt, without moving very aggressively  [on  the  funds  rate].  I don't want  to pin that rate  at  14  percent at  this  point,  but  I would be  slow to  react  on  that  side under our  normal operating procedures.  If  the market really thought  the money supply was  coming  in  low, we would get a big psychological  effect  in  the market that  would move  interest rates.  But  we would drag  in  changing our paths.  I think what  is  at  \fissue  is  how much we  drag  on the  up  side.  If we  set  these kinds  of specifications,  I would  sense--without  counting the  people who  did not talk  too  specifically, and many people did not--that  there  is  no eagerness  to  whack it  too  hard  if  growth comes  in above  the  ranges. We're  going to  get  some  reaction."], [414, "That's  a technical  term!  Let me  say, just in  round numbers,  that  we  start  at  $1.5  billion  [in  borrowings].  You know, precisely what has  happened after we argued  interminably  in  the last  two meetings about whether  the  target  should be  one percentage point more or  less,  is  that within  a week, or  literally a few days, the next money supply  figure  that  came  in was  over  anything we were talking  about.  So we moderately whacked  it,  I would say.  We raised the net  borrowed reserves, we  lowered  the  reserve path by $100  million or  so,  which was enough,  and we probably overshot  the reduction a little.  It was  enough  to  have  a very noticeable effect on  the market. Growth  in the  next week came  in pretty high, I think perhaps by coincidence.  If  it  came  in high  [in  the week ahead],  let's  say, but more moderately high than those numbers, maybe we wouldn't  do  anything for  a week to  see whether  it  was  confirmed  the next week.  If  it  came in  very high, we'd probably react  but more mildly  than we  did the previous two  times."], [416, "If  it  came  in  only slightly or moderately  above  the path."], [419, "No,  I think we're  saying  the  opposite  of  that.  We're very tolerant  of  an undershoot.  What  I am trying  to  pin down  is  how tolerant we are  of  an overshoot.  I think the  general sentiment  is  that  we're going  to be  less  tolerant  of  an  overshoot  than we  are  of undershoots.  But  should we be  tolerant at  all  of  an overshoot  is  the question or do we  react  very quickly?  My dilemma  is that  if we're  really not  tolerant  at  all  of  an overshoot, we  ought  to be whacking it  right now, which is  not what people  said.  So  on how tolerant we  are  of  an overshoot,  I suppose what  we're saying  is  that we'd be  fairly tolerant right  at  the moment  [up  to  the  specifications of]  alternative A.  If  it  got  above  alternative A, we'd be progressively less  tolerant."], [421, "Whether  the  funds  rate gets  over  17  percent or not  depends  upon how tolerant we  are."], [423, "That's right."], [425, "I'm not  sure we  can  escape this  problem by  saying we're  going to  consult  next week.

I can't be  perfectly specific  about how much we're going to  increase  it;  we haven't got  a formula for relating the  borrowing  level  precisely  to a new estimate  of  the money supply.

Let me  say  for all  its  difficulty, I think we were  concentrating more on  the right  variables  today.  And it was helpful  to me.  We have some underlying problems that  aren't going  to  go  away.  A number of  people made  comments, which  I think are understandable,  about whether  the whole process  of  gradualism makes sense.  I just  don't  think  that's  an issue  that  we  can decide at  this meeting.  Nor, indeed, is  it  an  issue that  is  up to  the Federal Reserve  itself because we're  not going  to deviate  successfully from what has  been  termed gradualism without  an effort by the government  right  across the board, of  which we would have  to be part.  When I speak of  collisions next year, I think you ought  to be  aware,  and I'm sure you  are,  of  the potential  for  the  Federal  Reserve to be  left  out  there  hanging alone  in  extremely unsatisfactory economic circumstances  with expectations,  deliberately  [encouraged]  or not,  of what we can  do about  inflation  through monetary policy alone much overdrawn.  And when policies  are not  a success,  there  will be  an inclination  for people  to  say  that  somehow inflation would have disappeared  if  we'd been  1/2 percentage point within  the  target instead of  1/2  percentage point  outside the target  or  if  we hadn't  had a big  fluctuation downward  in the  first  quarter and  upward in  the second quarter or whatever.  That  is  a conclusion that  I don't  think  \fbears  much relationship  to reality.

And other policies  don't make  the  least bit of difference.  Inflation is  purely  a monetary phenomenon.

You said we bought  as many marks  as  we  possibly could.  I didn't understand that to  be what people did when they  intervened.

I don't  think  it's  so much that  the  situation  is  uncertain, Emmett.  In my view, it has  been  uncertain for  some time.  Now I find it  threatening. That's  the tone;  my  feelings  echo Willis Winn's,  only  I haven't  been to  the  Middle East.  It  seems  to me  that  the  odds  are now getting  to be rather high that  there's going  to  be an oil  price  increase of  size. I don't  know that  it  will  be 50  percent, but I wouldn't be  surprised at  a $10  a barrel  increase.  And that's  going to have a considerable impact  on  inflation.  I must  say my view has  always been  that when an external  event like  this  occurs  it's  not  the right  response  to cut money growth targets  because no  other price  is  going  to  give.  If  we cut money  growth  targets, all  it  does  is  compound the  effect  of  the oil  price rise  on  real  activity by forcing  it  lower  than  it  otherwise would be.  And activity would already  tend to go  lower because  of  the oil price  rise.  Nevertheless,  it will be  adding  to  the  inflation numbers  and  so will  food prices.  Thus,  it  occurs  to me  that  what we might get  is  considerable  strength in  the demand  for money associated with a nominal GNP that  holds  up  [but  incorporates]  a decline  in  real activity and an  acceleration  in  inflation, which could keep a lot of pressure on  the money numbers.  In that  kind of  environment, I think interest  rates  could go  to  25  percent.  And that's  something  that  we have  to  be  thinking about--what  it means  for the  economy  to have rates above 20  percent--because that  may occur.  The  second  thing that  troubles  me is  that  we will be  having  fiscal  restraint  in  the  immediate  future;  that  is,  there's  a tax increase  in  six weeks.  On the  other hand, the new Administration promises tax reductions,  a series  of  them, which would certainly add to  pressures  in markets  over  that period  of  time  as  the government deficit  is  increased.  I also  agree  that  defense spending  is  going  up and is  going to  go up  sharply.  The new orders  figures  already show it.  The whole thrust  of  current  thinking is  that we will  have to  have a larger  defense establishment--and  I would almost  say  \"much larger\" defense establishment the  way the  talk is  going.  So without  a war, which is possible, we  have all  these  things  working against the [successful]  execution of policy.  I am very nervous about  limiting the  [governing  factor]--that  is,  the  perceived rate  of  growth that will be  appropriate  in monetary aggregates--by interest rate  constraints  because  if we  do  that,  we may lose  sight of what  is  really happening.  But  I guess I am prepared to limit  the  governing  factor  of  monetary expansion because  of  these uncertainties.  I rather  agree  that with prospects  for  increases  in defense,  taxes,  and  oil prices  we  don't want rates  to  go  down significantly because we're going  to  have an  almost  semi-war  economy in the  period to  come.  I also  think  interest rates  are  getting pretty  \fhigh.  We  are shutting  off  the  building industry.  We have  the  thrifts back  into  a lot  of  trouble.  That  6-month bill  rate means  that  they'll be  paying over  14  percent  for money this week, and  they can't  afford over  14  percent.  Neither  can a lot  of  small banks.  So we're beginning  to  threaten the  institutional  structures  of  the  economy again, as we did early this year.  So  I feel  that we  ought  to  constrain  interest  rate movements, at  least  for  a time,  Paul.  I have a fairly wide view  of  that,  though. My  funds rate  range would be  13  to  17  percent, centered on  15  percent which  is  where we are now.  I know it's  nice  to  say that we have a posture  that  we  don't want monetary growth  to  go up and,  therefore, regardless  of  what  is  happening, we're going  to hold the  target right where  it  was.  But  it's  very unrealistic  to  do  that.  If  we take alternative  B--assuming these November  numbers  are  still  more or  less holding, though I don't  know what  that  $700 million  increase means  for the projected number for  November--it means  that  to  hit  our  target, we have  to  have  a 5-1/2  percent rate  of  decline  in  the money supply in December.  A 5-1/2  percent  drop  is  a rapid rate  of  decline in  the money supply.  If  we want  to  go  to  alternative  C the way Larry does, and  [the  projection for]  November  is  right, we  have  to  have a 9 percent  rate  of  decrease.  That would be  the second largest  rate  of decrease we've ever  seen in  the  money supply in  the month of December. And I just  don't  think it's  responsible  to  have  a target  that  seems  to want such declines  to  occur.  They might  occur, but  to want  them to occur seems  to me  inappropriate.  Therefore,  I think we are  forced to alternative A as  the  target  for  the 2-month pattern, which is  an M-1A of  2 percent, an M-1B of  4-1/2  percent and an M2  of  7-3/4  percent.  Well,  the  latter  could be  7-1/2  percent;  we wouldn't have  to  have the  quarter.  So  that's what  I would recommend.  Alternatively, we  can  even  specify it  in terms  of  the quarterly growth rates, which I believe  the  draft directive  suggests.  Those are not high numbers:  4-1/2,  6-1/4,  and 8-1/4 percent.  I'd  specify it  in  those  terms  and take  a 13  to  17 percent  funds rate  range  and be  prepared to  see  those  aggregates come in markedly lower than  the  target  if  indeed  that is  what  develops. But  I am beginning  to  doubt  that  that will  develop  in the  period immediately to  come.  On borrowings,  I don't  know.  It's  a funny  thing and  I hate  to  mess with  it.  I think we ought  to have  them right about where they are because  it's  awfully hard to  assess what our  [rate increases]  last Friday will  do  to  tensions  in that borrowing market, with  the  2 point  surcharge.  So  I would  take a neutral  stance  and begin where we are  on borrowing  and see  how things  develop as  the period  goes on."], [323, "Well,  I know.  But  we had--"], [325, "That's what  I mean.  It  came  in high  for  the  week, but we  thought we were  on a target  of  $1.6 billion, and  that's where I would  [start]  it.

That's  what I would do--not have  an even-handed monetary target,  but aim to hit  \fthose numbers  that  I mentioned and  if  growth  of  the  aggregates  falls short,  let  the  shortfall  occur."], [342, "That's  consistent,  though, with having  13  to  17  percent  and  then providing, as we've  done previously, for  consultation of  the  Committee if  the  17  percent proves not  to be reasonable."], [344, "Yes.  The directive has  that  structure.  I  wasn't  criticizing  [your  suggestion];  I was just  making a point  that what you  said is  consistent with choosing 13  to  17  percent  and emphasizing  the possible need  for consultation, which also  goes with what  Bill  said, I think."], [351, "They couldn't have a range--"], [362, "Abstracting  from that."], [379, "Well,  $1.6  billion is  right  in  between."], [381, "We  could say  \"in the early months  of next  year,\"  or  something like  that."], [393, "I do.

I think  the  economy is  going  to ease  off  considerably;  I think inflation  is  extremely  intractable;  and I think volatility in interest  rates  is  going to  give us  a real problem, so  I would not  like  to  see  rates  go up  very much because I don't want  to  see them  come down very much  in the  first  quarter.  We are going to  have a great deal  of  trouble with this  yo-yo effect.  I like the  technique we  are  using because  it  has  a tendency  to get interest  rates  to  go more rapidly where they  appear to need  to  go in an inflationary environment.

For most we  are waiting  for each  of  the  central banks  to  indicate which specific instrument  in their market,  a Treasury bill  or whatever,  corresponds most  closely to  our  Treasury bill.  In most  cases  there should be little difficulty.  But  in  two  important  instances, with the Bundesbank and with the  Bank of  Japan,  the  corresponding  instruments to  our Treasury bill  are not  obvious.  We must be  careful  not  to  link our swap drawings  to  a higher cost  instrument  than a Treasury bill might be.  For swap  arrangements on which we are  not  likely to  draw, I see no  need to  negotiate a specific  instrument  on  their side. Nevertheless, we could come down  to the wire on  some  of  these negotiations,  so  I would like  to  recommend  that  the Committee  approve the  renewal  of  swap  arrangements now subject  to a final  review and determination by the  FOMC subcommittee when  these negotiations  have been completed that  the  terms  and conditions are  acceptable.  So  it involves agreeing generally now that we  can proceed with the negotiations and then  a review by the  subcommittee  that  the  terms  on the  elimination  of  the  sharing of  risk  and on  the particular instruments  that we will  be using are acceptable  to  the Committee."], [148, "But  they are  important  elements  of  the  negotiation."], [150, "We want  to know what  interest  rate we are  going  to  be paying on  the  marks we borrow."], [152, "Well, approval of  the  renewal  of  the  [swaps]."], [154, "Yes, December 4th  is  the  first maturity for a  number  of  them."], [159, "Right.

We're done.  At most  we have  four weeks  in which to operate  and the  reserves will  be  set with lagged reserve  requirements. So  it  seems  to me what we're  really talking about  is  how high we're going to  let  interest rate  go between now and the  end of  the year, and that's  it.  I am also  strongly  of  the  opinion that  rates  are  already too high.  We have  already killed  the housing market.  We are depressing  the automobile market.  We  have  continued pressure on business  fixed  investment,  and it's  to  a point where  I think it will stall  out.  I would  like to  point  out  to you  that  the  last  time we  had a  federal  funds  range  approximately  like  this was  in February of  last year and we had  a 9-1/2 percent  drop  in real  GNP in  the  second quarter.  I think  the  changes  in  interest  rates have  influenced a great  deal  the pattern  [of  GNP growth]  we  got this  year.  And  I don't think  the  staff has  done  a bad  job.  I went back and looked at  their fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter projection of  February  of  last year and they had a decline  for  the year  of about  2 percent.  And if  they have  the  fourth quarter  right now,  it's  going  to be  a decline of  about 1-1/2  percent this year.  The pattern was  different;  the pattern  of interest rates was not  the one  anticipated.  I think  these  rising interest rates  have an extraordinarily damping  effect on the  economy and  if  we let  them go any higher,  we're  inviting disaster  again.  In addition, we'd be  [inviting]  a rerun  of  the great  interest rate  cycle of  1980  on an  economy that  is  not where  it was  last  February.  Last February we were  at  85  percent  capacity utilization  and at  6 percent unemployment.  A  lot  of  things  were different  than they are  now.  We have a relatively  severely depressed  economy  that would be put through the wringer again  and I think that would be a mistake.  Some of  you say you're going  to  take  \"B\" because  it's  no  different  from what  we did  last  time.  There's a  4 percentage point increase  in the  federal  funds  rate  range  associated with  \"B.\"  9 to  15  percent  [last month]  and  the  staff  is  saying  \"B\" is  [now] compatible with 13  to  18  percent.  I think  18  percent  is  outrageously high.  On  account  of  the  growth in  the money supply, we immediately run  everything up to the  top of the  range, usually within a week after the Open Market  Committee meeting.  Consequently, I don't  care what you do with -the money supply.  I do  care what you do with the  interest rate range.  I would put  the maximum at  15  percent  with maybe  a bottom of  11  percent.  The  borrowing assumption  is  funny because we  determine the borrowing from  the nonborrowed reserve path.  By doing a nonborrowed reserve path, at  least  for  the next  two weeks, we determine what  the  borrowings are  going  to be.  There's  a Catch-22 game  going on here.

Why couldn't  we have  done more?"], [12, "My second question:  You said  the  dollar might  have  been driven to  levels  that would have  been perceived as unsustainable  without  this  intervention.

I believe that  is  right and I believe  intervention can have  that  function.  And it's  an important effect.

We want a strong  dollar because  it  helps on  inflation.  We don't want  it  to get  so  strong that  we're not competitive.  We've had considerable appreciation  in real  terms.  And as  far as  the  accumulation of  reserves is  concerned,  in the  long run  I think we have  to  become  like other  countries and rely on owned reserves,  not  on  the  swaps  that others  can deny us  the use of.  And we ought  to  be building up  some reserves gradually."], [102, "That  is  for monetary policy reasons not  because  they made decisions  about  reserves.  I think we ought  to bear  in mind first Tony's  point  that--"], [104, "I  think gains  and  losses  in  the exchange market  have  to  be evaluated  including  the  interest  that  one  earns.  On one side  if we  have  D-marks,  as  Tony says,  the  chances are  that  in  the long  run the D-mark will  be stronger  than  the dollar,  but  we will  have lower  interest earnings  on  that.  On the  other hand,  if  we  owe D-marks, having drawn  on  the  swap,  say, that  is  an  adverse position because  the D-mark may appreciate.  If  we pay interest  in D-mark terms,  we would be benefitting  from that.  So  the  interest to  some extent  counteracts  the  risk  factor  insofar  as  the risk  factor  is  based on purchasing power parity considerations,  which will  not work out exactly  in  the  long run.  Also,  I would  like to  remind you that  other countries have  enormous  reserves.  The Germans  still  have,  I think, $40  billion;  they had  $50  billion plus.  The Japanese  have  $20 billion.  They all  take  a great  risk because these  reserves  are mostly in  dollars,  which from  their perspective  have  depreciated, giving  them losses.  We have  a very  large  gold stock.  Every time  the gold price moves, we  are becoming richer  or poorer.  We  [never]  pay any attention to  that,  and  rightly  so.  But  let  us not  say that  we  are without exchange risks  from the movement  [in  the  value]  of  our  financial assets."], [138, "I would like  to  add to what  Scott  said about  the purposes  of  intervention.  There  are  those  two  reasons  he mentioned.  One  is  countering disorder, not maintaining  order;  we sometimes say  it  is  countering disorder.  Disorder this  time  seems  to be mostly on  the way up whereas  in the  past  it usually was  encountered on  the  way down.  There  is  also  accumulating  for  future needs.  And I would say that  forming a reserve  is  provided for  in  that.  But  the main qualification  is  that  it  has  to  conform with article  IV, paragraph something,  of  the  IMF  articles of  agreement.  And that  gives a fairly wide degree of  latitude  for  intervention in conditions  of floating  [exchange rates].  prepared to  do,  such as  driving the  exchange rate.

The answer  is  to  filter  it  and give it  little weight.  We may be  \fgiving too much weight  to  the weekly data, but  to  throw  them away totally just  reduces  the  accuracy of  the  steering mechanism."], [214, "I can't  see how one  can believe  in markets  and then try  to  avoid  supplying  information, however  [questionable  it  is]."], [257, "Well,  that gives  excessive weight to  the  achievement  of  the  target for  the  rest  of  the year.

But we  also now  face  the prospect of  a greater degree  of weakness hereafter resulting  from  this  strength.  In  other words, it puts  somewhat  of  a ceiling  on  the  development  of  the  economy if  it becomes  really  strong temporarily and  that raises  interest  rates  to levels  that will  push the  economy down again.  I would not  try  to counteract  the prospective dip in the  economy, if  that  is what might happen in  the  first  quarter.  I think we  ought  to  look  further  ahead into  the  future, both with regard to  the  real  sector and the monetary aggregates.  Now, I think the  chances  of  a repetition of  the  second quarter  of  1980  are very slight,  even  if  interest  rates don't go down as  sharply as  they did then.  I doubt  that  the economy will  suffer anything  like that.  But  the chances  of  a severe  drop in  interest rates  are there  again.  And if  we  [allow]  that  a second  time--if interest rates  go  up  and then  go  down again in  a yo-yo  fashion--we will be  accused, reasonably,  of destabilizing interest  rates beyond what  is  necessary.  Our new techniques do  imply  that  interest rates will be more volatile, and  that's  the  way the economy  is  kept on  track under  these conditions.  But we  shouldn't yield  to  that  tendency of the  system very much.  So  far as  the  aggregates  are concerned, my inclination would  be  to  try to  get back on  track  in the  first quarter of  1981  but not in the  present quarter,  even if  that  were possible by a drastic wrench. But at  the  same  time,  I'd  try to  limit the  interest  rate  implications of  that.  The  interest  rate  implications  of  just  saying we  are going to  get back on track  in early  1981 might be  to  allow interest rates  to drop quite  far  if  the  economy  is weak.  I would say we  should aim at  a relatively reasonable  growth path  from here  on  out;  something between \"A\" and  \"B\" might do  it  if  we want to  be  back on track with M-1B in the  first quarter,  but not with  the  interest rates  specifications of \"A\" or  \"B.\"  The  interest  rate specifications of  \"C\" give us  a chance, if  interest  rates  tend  to  go  down sharply, at  least  to review the situation and not to  accept  the  slide willy-nilly as we did in  the second quarter."], [266, "I don't  feel very  strongly about  the  19  percent [upper  limit  for the  funds  range].

Now, one  way of  not  capping but flooring  the  rate  on the  down side would be to  set  a rather high  [level  for  the  lower]  limit,  and  I suggested  14 percent.

It's  an important point, but we  have spent right much time,  so  I'll wait."], [327, "It  seems  that way.  The  first question is:  How much confidence  can we have  in  the  relationship between  the rates  of growth  in  the  aggregates and  the  federal  funds  range  as  specified by the  alternatives?  Everybody realizes  that  [estimating  this relationship]  is  a very  risky business at  best  and that  we probably ask the  staff to  accomplish  the impossible  there.  The  second question is:  What are the  risks  involved if  we miss  the  paths specified in  the alternative we  choose, whatever that  happens  to  be?  I would consider a further miss  on  the up  side  to be  pretty significant--much more  so, of  course,  if  we go  with  \"A,\"  less  so  if  we  go with  \"B,\"  and maybe not so  significant  if  we go  with  \"C.\"  But perhaps  the most  important issue  of  all  is  the  likely effects  on  inflationary expectations  of whatever policy option we  select.  They would be clearly worse under \"A.\"  That would involve  raising  the  path for  M-1A for  the  fourth straight month in  the  face  of  overshoots.  I looked back and found that  we had raised the December target  figure  for  M-lA by a total  of $5.7  billion  over  the  last  three meetings.  If  we do more  of  that,  it certainly would not  augur well  for  inflationary psychology. Alternative B would involve not adjusting  the  target  in  the  face  of some  overshoots  and would, of  course, be  less  detrimental  to inflationary psychology.  I think  \"C\" would work positively  [in  that regard],  and although I don't  think  there is  any earthly way we could hit  the  target as  specified by the end of  the  year, we  could conceivably be within the  range  for  M-1B.  In any event,  I think it  would be better  if  we were  perceived  as working  toward a range even  if  we  miss  it,  as  I suspect we necessarily will.  Finally, there  is  the question  of what  this  implies for the  1981  targeting problems, which we've  talked about.  All  of these  options  are going  to  involve some upward base drift,  a problem with which we have  contended for  many years.  Presumably  \"C\" would involve  less  upward drift,  although  I doubt  there  is  going to  be  a great deal  of  difference.  So,  I would come  out  for  \"C.\"  I wouldn't object  to widening  the  federal  funds  range;  I have never objected to that.  I don't like  a range anyway,  so  to  cover both  \"B\" and \"C\" 13  to 19  percent would seem good  to me.  So  far  as  the  borrowing  figure  is concerned, I would  start off where we are now on borrowing.  But  then if  borrowing deviates  from  the  figure we  select initially, I think  we ought  to  adjust  the nonborrowed reserve  target  in  the opposite direction by  that  full  amount.  In  looking  at  the reasons  for misses in  the past,  I think part of  the blame lies with the  Committee  in not having  selected the  proper  range, but  in  retrospect  I believe  we  have not been sufficiently  active  in  adjusting our nonborrowed reserves target  to  compensate  for misses in  the borrowing  figure."], [465, "That's  whacking  it  lightly."]], "MR TRUMAN": [[23, "I am  not  sure  about our  trading partners per se.

We'd all  like  to be  able  to  produce a smooth  2 percent  real growth  rate  for  the  next  couple  of  years but  I don't  think that's compatible with our  attempts  to decelerate  the rate  of monetary growth gradually.  It  seems  to me that  the  rather  small  undulations  in economic  activity that  are probably ahead  of us,  as  much as we may dislike  them, can't  be  avoided.  We have  probably produced a great deal  by our  actions  in  the  past months  that  is  not yet  reflected in the economic  statistics  or  in  the monetary growth rates.  Nonetheless, I like  the  alternative B growth  rates  for  the  aggregates  simply because  I don't  think we can  continue  to  raise  our objectives  for  the quarter month after month in  response  to  unexpectedly high  increases in  the  aggregates.  We did it  last month.  But I don't  think we  can maintain our  credibility if  we respond  to  bulges  in  the aggregates by raising  their  targets.  So  I would  stay with the  growth path  for the aggregates  that  the  Committee voted  for  last month.  I would set  a 13 to  17  percent  funds  rate  range because  I have  a feeling that we  can accomplish our  objective within  that.

But  this  time  I really mean it.  We  obviously face uncertainty  in  the  fiscal  outlook resulting from recent political  developments.  Also, as you and Mr. Winn mentioned, there  is  uncertainty  in  the energy price picture.  Also, with possible  changes  in  the discount  rate and the  surcharge, we  don't know what bank attitudes will  be toward borrowing.  So  the  picture  is very cloudy.  Despite  that,  there  seems  to be an unusual  amount  of agreement  as  to  the  direction in which we should move.  I would say that  in light  of  all  these  uncertainties, the  staff  forecast is  about as  reasonable as  one  could expect,  and I see  no reason to  disagree with that  forecast.  I feel  that  if  we were to  take any action that would result  in a significant raising  of  the  targets,  that would certainly be open  to  an  erroneous  interpretation, or  perhaps even  the right  interpretation but  certainly one  that we would not  like to  see. And it would definitely run  the risk  of  adding  to  inflationary expectations.  So,  I would not opt  for alternative A.  On the  other hand,  it  seems  to me  that  any further  move toward restrictiveness would have  the very undesirable effect  of  making the projected decline in  economic  activity  in the  early part  of  the  year sharper  than we would like  to  see  or  sharper  than might prove to be  the  case  if we followed a more moderate course.  Therefore,  I would support alternative B.  And  I agree with Governor Gramley that  interest rates  \fare now about as  high as  they need to  be.  So  I would combine my support of  alternative B with a  federal  funds  range  of  12  to  16 percent.  Now, the growth that we get,  of  course, may be  inconsistent with this  federal  funds  rate  range.  If  it  is,  I would be prepared  to see  the  funds rate  somewhat  higher--maybe  one percentage point higher. But  I would not  like  to  see  that  occur without  the advantage  of additional  information."]], "MR ROOS": [[82, "To  further  confuse the  issue,  look on page  10  of  the  Bluebook.  I was  always  under  the  impression  that  strong interest rates  domestically tend  to  attract  foreign money into  our  economy and bolster the value of  the  dollar.  But on  the bottom of  page  10  it  says \"Continued intervention by the  United  States  to  slow the appreciation of  the  foreign  exchange  value of  the  dollar  could generate  additional pressure  in Treasury yields,  as  the Fed offers  securities  to  the market  to  finance  foreign currency purchases.\"  It  looks  as  though, if I understand this, we are  totally  chasing  our  tail  because we are selling  [Treasury securities]  in  order  to  seek  [less]  appreciation  in the value  of  the dollar  in  foreign exchange  markets,  and  in  the process we  are doing something  that  could generate  additional  downward pressure on Treasury yields.  I  thought  that  upward pressure on Treasury yields  is  what bolsters  the  value  of  the  dollar.  Or do I have it  totally backwards?"], [86, "Except  for  what?  It  certainly doesn't  do--"], [176, "Will  we get  back on  the  Friday  cycle  this  week?"], [225, "In this  connection,  could someone  just  report  briefly on the  progress  of  Steve's effort  to  restudy how we  are doing?"], [251, "Mr. Chairman, could I just repeat my question to  Steve  on the  technical  study of  how we  go  about  achieving our  targets? Is  that  progressing well?"], [307, "Well,  some of  what  I say will  be a repetition of what Roger said.  If  one  goes back  to the  fundamentals  of what we are trying to  do,  I don't  think there's  any question  that  if  anything emerged from  the November  4 experience,  it was  a recognition that  the people of  this  country--and we are  serving them--are  primarily and indelibly concerned with  something being done about  inflation.  I think the second  fundamental  that we have  to  address  is  the  eroding credibility of  our  ability to perform effectively  in what we've announced we're trying  to do.  If we  continue to  operate  as we  have all  year--I'm talking about  our operating procedures--I would agree with the  Chairman  that  the choice we make  today  in  terms  of  the alternatives will  probably have very little  effect  on anything because [the  results  for  the year]  probably won't be  a reflection  of  the choice we make.  However,  if  the  Bluebook  is  correct,  it's  too  late really  to accomplish our  annual  objective in  terms  of  the  targets  for the aggregates.  But whatever action we  take  today will have a very real  effect on  our  credibility.  Recognizing  that  the world knows  that we're above  the upper  limit  of  our  M-1B target,  for  example,  if  we don't  choose  an alternative  that  at  least  appears  to attempt  to correct  for  that  overshoot,  I think we will  see  a further erosion  of our  credibility.  Secondly,  another  factor  that  is  currently  affecting our  credibility is  the  increasing  suspicions  on  the part  of  the public that we  are  indeed moving back  toward what  I at  least  consider  to  be a failed policy of  attempting  to  stabilize  interest  rates.  Therefore, our  fed funds  range  should not be  narrower  than the width we've adhered  to  most  of  this  year.  I would opt  for alternative  C.  Under any circumstances,  the  danger that  I would perceive  in the  future would be permitting  interest  rates  to drop  significantly.  And I would  \fnot  like  to  see us  set  a lower  limit  of  the  funds  range at  less  than 14  percent.  Finally,  I would hope desperately that  by February, when we go  into  [our  deliberations  for  our targets]  next year, Steve's  study will  have been conducted and will be  taken seriously.  And I hope  it will be  conducted, as  I know it  will be, with an open mind to  see whether we  can't  come up with a better operating procedure  that would reduce  the potential  margin of  error between  the actions  we take  at these meetings or  the  alternatives we  choose and how the  aggregates actually  [turn out]."], [309, "No,  sir.

I haven't been with him since  last spring,  so--"], [288, "I was,  too.  I don't think we  ought  to  try  to  prevent  a decline  in economic  activity in  the  first  quarter.  It's  too late  for  that.  I think the  staff  is  right  that  it  is  in the  cards. But  I believe  the  staff may be underestimating the  severity of  the decline  that  could occur early next year  for two  reasons.  One  is  that when the  staff  put  its  forecast  together  last week, it was  able  to write:  \"Our forecast  assumes  a further  rise in  interest rates.\"  That no  longer is  true.  The  rise  in  interest  rates which  the  staff assumed is  already here;  it has  happened.  So  interest  rates  are going to  have  \fto  decline somewhat  from present  levels  if  the  staff's  forecast  is going to hold.  The second  reason is  that  the  staff  has built  into  its forecast  for next year,  and has  continuously done  so  since  early 1980, an assumption  that  the money demand function  is  going  to  shift  down. That  assumed shift,  when  they  first put  it  in,  was  a year away.  But now it  is  right ahead;  it  is  six weeks  ahead.  If  that  shift doesn't happen, then interest  rates  not  only are not  going  to  stay at  current levels  or go  down a bit,  but  as  the  staff  indicates,  they will  have  to go up  3-1/2 percentage points  further in  the  first  quarter.  If we  get bill  rates  in  the  16  to  17  percent range  and the  prime  rate  in  the range of  19  to  20  percent  for  the quarter as  a whole,  then peak rates will probably exceed  their  levels  of  last  spring.  And then  I am not at  all  sure  that we would not  be  in  for  a decline  in economic  activity every bit  as  severe  as  the  one we had in  the  second quarter of  1980.  Now, we  are  facing a very difficult  long-run  inflation  problem.  I don't  see  any reason  for  thinking  that any improvement  has occurred at  all yet.  But  it  would be extremely counterproductive  to follow a course of  policy which pushed  the  economy  over  the  cliff  once more.  I think interest  rates  are high enough now.  I don't want  to see  them decline much;  on  that I agree with Governor Wallich entirely. I think  they should  stay about where  they are but  not  come  down much from here.  We  have  recently seen performance  in  the money measures along  the  lines  that we wanted.  We're  starting  to  see  the  slowdown we have been  trying to get.  In the past  four weeks,  as you  indicated, the  M1 numbers  show rough  stability if we balance off  M-1A and M-1B. I could go with either of  Steve's  suggestions:  Either narrowing the federal  funds  range  or  setting  some upper  limit to  the  growth rate  of the monetary aggregates  and accepting  a shortfall, provided the numbers  come  out right.  If  I were going to  select  the  federal  funds range  that  suited my predilections,  it would be  something  like  12  to 15  percent.  Or  if  I wanted to  go  in the  other  direction,  I would take the  specs  of  \"A\" and accept any shortfall  in money growth  from  that."], [369, "How much lower?"], [387, "Mr. Chairman, what would happen under  these specifications  if,  in  fact, we  came out  from now to  the  end of  the year with what  I would consider to  be  a very  fine performance  of  the monetary aggregates,  i.e.,  no  change  in  M-1A.  If M-1A were completely flat  and  let  us  suppose  that  in fact  $1.5  billion  in borrowing were consistent with the  specs  of  \"B,\"  then what we would end  up doing  I think--if  I'm wrong, maybe  Steve  or Peter  could enlighten me--would be taking actions  deliberately  to  push interest  rates  up  further.  And instead of  a federal  funds rate  of  15  percent we would end up with 17 percent."], [454, "Should we  instruct  the  staff  to  calculate the  nonborrowed reserve path  accordingly?"], [457, "Well,  it  isn't  going to  happen.  You have no  worries,  Henry, between now and the middle of December  on how low interest  rates are  going to go.  The worry is  in  the  first  or  second quarter of  next year.  And I think  the higher we put  interest rates now, the greater the  danger is  that  by the  second quarter  economic activity is going to  be  in  a nice  steep decline  and  interest rates  are going  to be  falling like a stone.  We're  going  to  be chasing  the money supply.  The way to  keep out  of  this  is,  as  the  Chairman says,  to not whack it  too much now, to  let  things  settle  down.  We've  gone a long way.  And we  have gone a long, long way just  since  October.  We've increased short-term interest rates  by something  like 2-1/2  to  3 percentage points  in  a month.  In  a month!  We've  increased long-term interest  rates by a percentage point  or  so,  a bit  less  for mortgage rates.  Those  are  enormous  increases by historical  standards.  We are really resisting money growth.  I think  the Chairman is  quite right  in that.  We're  showing our  determination.  And we have let  interest rates move  through  swings  since  the  summer, since  recovery began, that are just  totally unprecedented.  Let's wait  and see  what happens."], [459, "[Unintelligible.]"]], "MR GUFFEY": [[117, "The Committee does  have  rules with respect  to  what  the  Desk can hold."], [120, "Well,  there  is  an  intermeeting limit  as  well  as  a maximum we  can hold in any one currency.  Aren't we getting  at or near  that  limit?  If  it  is  not  changed--"], [124, "So  in  the  period ahead, we are  talking about  accumulating a maximum of  $400  million  in marks  unless we have  a notation vote  to change  the  limit  during  the  intermeeting interval."], [126, "That  seems  reasonable."], [295, "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  With regard  to  the  economy,  the  staff's projection seems  reasonable.  I would just note that  they  consistently have underestimated the  strength of  the economy.  And  if  that  continues  through  the  remainder of  this  quarter, we  could have  some  of  the  additional  pressures  that  Steve  spoke  of  on interest rates.  On  the  other hand, if  I understand the  Bluebook correctly, for  the  first  time  in several  months the  staff has  not built  into  any of  the  alternatives  any further  downward shift  in demand for money over  this remaining  two-month period.  So  it  would give me  some  comfort  that we may come  closer  to  hitting those  numbers between now and  the  end of  the year  than we have  in  the  last  couple of months when we experienced overshoots  from the  staff's  projections  at the  time  of  the  Committee meeting.  Coming  down  to policy considerations,  it  seems  to  me  there are  a couple of  things.  The Federal  Reserve  has  a credibility problem.  It  has  been talked about around this  table.  Last  month we  chose  to  adopt  ranges  for  the aggregates  for  the quarter that  insured  that we would be outside the [annual]  range  for  at  least  two  of  the  three  targets--M-1B and M2."], [297, "No, but we understood that  if we hit  those  targets  it  would take M-1B  outside  for  the year."], [299, "I would agree with that.  And unfortunately, the  misses  have  always been on the high side."], [301, "And that brings  in the  credibility question,  which I'd like  to  address."], [303, "And the  revisions  have  all  gone  one way,  unfortunately."], [305, "As  to  the  credibility problem, of  course,  we  will  be  in  a new era  after the  change of  Administration and the change of  Congress.  And the  Federal Reserve  is  going  to  be looked at  in terms of  how we  plan to perform.  It  seems  important  to me  that  we not adopt  aggregate  targets  at  this meeting  that  would suggest we are taking another  step,  as  Frank Morris  pointed out,  toward insuring  that we  will miss  the  aggregate  target  for  1980  to an even greater extent. It  seems  to me  that  \"B\" is  consistent with what we  set  last month; thus  I would opt  for  the B alternative with a funds  rate  range  of  13 to  17  percent,  having in mind that  if  we have underestimated the strength of  the economy  for  the  remainder of  this year, we may be using that  17  percent.  I am really suggesting that  a cap of  17 percent  might be appropriate."], [370, "The  fact  of  the matter  is  that borrowing  has been  higher  than  $1.6  billion.  Over  the  4-week period it has  been about  $1-3/4  billion;  it  has  only been  $1.6  billion  for  the week that we're  in now.  So  what  we're  really looking  at  in  terms  of  the recent borrowing  level  is  somewhat  higher than that  $1.6  billion."]], "MR BALLES": [[131, "Mr. Chairman, I wonder if  I could ask Scott  a  question.  I would be  interested, Scott,  in your views on  the divergent  trend between  the  spot  and the  forward rates  last month. The  dollar rose by  an average  of  1.1  percent against  six major countries on a trade-weighted basis.  But  the forward rate  for  one year went down by about  .3 percent.

Broadly speaking, the  dilemma that we've been  faced with for  some months has gotten worse.  In a sense, we  are  still  the  only game  in  town in  terms of  an  anti-inflation policy.  Despite  the  election, if  one  looks  at bond yields,  inflation expectations  haven't gone down.  The fact  that the  forward rate on  the  dollar has  actually gone down may indicate that  inflation expectations  in the view of  foreigners have gotten worse.  And while  I continue  to  hope month by month, as  does Steve, that  these  higher interest rates  will  result  in some downward  shift  in the demand  for money, I see a contrary trend going  on.  I think we are going to  experience more of  it because  the  cost of  long-term money is so  darn high  that  there  is  immense  incentive  on the  part of businesses to borrow short--that  is,  in  the commercial  paper market or through banks--and  that drives  deposits up.  So I expect this  recent surge  in business  loans  to  continue.  As  I see  it,  the  really damaging thing  to  the  economy is  the  height of  long-term interest rates,  and I don't  see how we are going to  get  them down until  inflation  expectations  come down and until  the budget of  the new Administration gets  sorted  out, which is  going  to be a source of  uncertainty.  Meanwhile, we have to worry about whether our monetary growth rates  themselves  are becoming a source  of inflation expectations, as  some  of  my directors  and a good many of  the professors  at  our  recent  academic conference  think  is  the  case.  In view of  all  of  this,  I think it  is  too  late  in  the year to  aim for \"C,\"  which  is  a meat  ax  tactic;  so  the next  less  damaging  [posture] would be  to  stay pretty much with  \"B\" as  Messrs.  Morris, Guffey, and some  others  have  said.  I wouldn't want  to  increase  further the ranges that  we are  shooting for.  Furthermore, I would not be  inclined  to narrow the  federal  funds  range, as  some people have  [suggested].

One  can  discount  that very heavily  in  terms of  a need  for  information.  But  there are  other  countries  in  the world, it  seems  to me, that  operate  their monetary policy without going  through this  tremendous  expenditure  of  resources  and  all  the problems  of  revising  and re-revising  and  interpreting and re- interpreting  the  data."], [339, "I'm disheartened, as  everyone is,  about the  alternatives  in  front of  us.  On the  inflation  front,  Paul,  everything we have  discussed and everything we  see  is  disheartening except  the possible outside  chance of  house prices weakening  due  to a disaster  in the  housing market.  That's clearly  shaping up  in front  of us.  I feel strongly that  it's  too  late  to  try to  salvage the year-to-year growth rates  in the monetary aggregates because  it would require a very sharp adjustment that  would be extremely difficult  to  achieve.  So  I would come  out,  for essentially  the  same  reasons Mr. Balles mentioned, in favor  of  alternative B with  the proviso  that the aggregate  growth targets  be viewed as a maximum.  I would not  be  inclined to  narrow  the range  on the  fed funds  rate.  With regard  to what  Governor Partee said--he  threw  in  something about how we communicate  this  to  the other regulators--I do  think we are headed into  a period of very difficult times  for  the thrift  institutions.

That's  just another  inevitable side  effect  of  this period we are  entering.  Should we get  a crisis  in  the Middle East, based on the  OPEC meetings  and consultations around  this  time,  I think we would have to  consider reconvening this  Committee  to restudy our entire program in light  of  the  experience back in  '74 when we went through  [an  oil  crisis]  the  last time.

The  first-quarter projection may be right,  although I must  say  I am impressed by how  strong the  economy has  consistently been and how wrong we have consistently been  about  that  strength.  What that  does to me  is  to tend  to  shorten my sights  and make me  less  concerned about what may be happening  in  1981  and more  concerned about  looking to  the short  term.  And  even though we  can no  longer achieve  our targets  for the year,  I think we  ought  to  stick pretty much with what we had.  So that brings me  to  \"B.\"  I would not narrow the  funds  range.  We  have been criticized and will  be  criticized  for  erratic  interest rates  but we are  equally criticized  for  erratic money growth.  And I think the limitations  on  the  funds  rate have  had some  effect  in permitting money growth  to  exceed  our targets.  So  I would stick with the  range  that we already have,  do what we  can to  get within the  limits  of  the  targets for this  year, and  start  off  as  low as  possible for  1981.

I agree entirely with Mr. Winn's  comments  about the uncertainties  associated with oil  and  I agree  that  the whole  fiscal economic policy  area  is  one where what  does  or does  not  come  out of the  hopper could have an enormous  impact  on expectations  if  nothing else.  In  looking at policy, I am driven by two  conflicting  thoughts.  One  is  the  desire  to  come  as  close  to  the  1980  targets as we  can,  or  at  least  in  line with Mr. Morris's  comments  not  to  adjust the  targets  for  the  current  quarter upward at  this point.  But at  the same time  I'd like  to enter  1981  on a growth  trajectory that  is roughly compatible  with what  our targets  for  1981 might  be.  There  is a bit of  a paradox  in  that  I think  the first  criteria would bring one squarely to  \"B\" and the  second  in  some  sense might bring  one to  \"A\" in terms  of  the  growth rates  for  the aggregates.  I would reconcile  that paradox by accepting  aggregate growth numbers  somewhere around  \"B\" or maybe a bit higher.  But in  line with one  of  Steve's  suggestions,  I'd treat  those  numbers as maximums, with the  explicit  understanding that if  we were hitting  or  exceeding those maximums  we would adjust  the nonborrowed  growth targets  to  offset  any growth  over  the maximum.  I  \frecognize  that  that  in  itself would probably mean that  we'd end up above  the maximum for the  period anyway because  of  the  time  it  takes to  know we  are  above  them and then  to  respond.  But I, too, am a bit encouraged by  these more  recent money  supply numbers.  And if  there were some  maximum, I think it  is  possible  that  such a maximum could be compatible with a funds  rate band of  maybe  13  to  16  or  13  to  17 percent.

It  comes  down to  a judgment as  to  how much  of  an  impact  the  things we  already have done will have.

I think there  is much  to what Mr.  Partee  has  said about prices  and wages,  even given  fairly  strong monetary and  fiscal pressures  and whatever pressures  [come  from]  substantial  unused resources  in the  economy.  And  that means  to me that  about all monetary policy can do  is  to avoid fueling  additional  inflation.  Even though we  have had what we  thought was  a fairly tight  policy for the last  couple of  years  it  has nevertheless  accommodated  additional inflation, so we must be pretty  careful  to  try to  avoid that  situation continuing in  1981.  I am not  impressed with  the  idea  that we  can slowly and gradually wring inflation out  of  the  economy using monetary and fiscal policy.  I see  inflation strengthening and  I see more and more people  apparently making a very good  living out  of marketing inflation  protection gadgetry and developing what  seems  to me  to be very high risk  loans  or uses  of  credit  for  that purpose.  I read that as  indicating  that  inflation momentum or  expectations  are  still strengthening rather  than weakening.  On monetary policy, I would think that  the  surcharge will  pretty effectively discourage borrowing by the  large  banks,  so  I would not expect  high levels of  borrowing in  the weeks  immediately ahead.

And  I am  sorry to  share  the view that  we do have a fairly near-term end to  this  recovery that  has  gotten  started, given what needs  to  be done  in  terms  of  monetary and fiscal  [policy]."], [490, "I would  think, Mr.  Chairman--and I presume  this  is  going on or  will  go  on--that  it  would be  desirable  to  get  the new President  to  commit  his  credibility  as  early  as  possible  to attacking  inflation for  the purpose  of  trying  to  erode  somewhat  the possibility that  we will  be  standing  out  there  alone."], [495, "But  I  think  that's  a pretty small  group."], [497, "I know  it's  a very vocal  group but  I think  it's  pretty small."], [501, "I assume we're not prepared to disavow that."], [505, "Very often  [the  interpretation  is]  even  narrower.  It's  if  you wouldn't print  so much money."]], "MR DOYLE": [[337, "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There have been  two  prominent themes  in  the discussion  so  far,  and I certainly would emphasize  that  there  is  some  inherent  conflict between what  to  do about  the  uncertainties on  the  one  hand and what  to  do  about  the credibility issue  on  the other.  The uncertainties question, as Governor  Partee  and others have already pointed out,  may be changing from that status  to  something  closer to  [a  real  threat]  in terms  of the energy situation.  I believe the  reaction to movement in  either direction on  that  is  difficult  to  determine.  That  is,  if  a change does  occur  or  is  suggested in either direction, it's hard to  say just how the market or  anybody else would react  in  terms of  dealing with these  uncertainties  that I don't believe are  perceived by the markets generally at  the  present  time.  On  the credibility side,  I might suggest  that  the  issue may not be  that we  have  a credibility problem but  that we don't  have one.  In  fact,  I think the public and market perception of  the  Federal  Reserve, as  someone else has  just suggested, is  that we  are  the  only game  in town and that we are  doing the  job right.  Therefore,  I would not  like to  see  any further  slippage  from the  targets  that were  [adopted]  last month.  I believe  it would have  a severe  credibility  [impact]  and would produce  some negative reactions. Therefore, I would  support  alternative B with some  slight narrowing of the  funds  range,  perhaps  to  13  to  17  percent."]], "MR ALTMANN": [[478, "Seven."], [480, "Eight."], [488, "Chairman Volcker  Vice Chairman  Solomon  Governor Gramley  President Guffey  President Morris  Governor Partee  Governor Rice  President Roos  Governor Schultz  Governor Teeters  Governor Wallich  President Winn   It's  10  for--  Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No Yes No"], [508, "I am told  that  it  is."]]}
