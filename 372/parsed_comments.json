{"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER": [[1, "We're  sending  out  a search party for  Governor  Schultz.  I don't  know whether he  is back in  Florida  or not. I just wanted to  [bring]  you all  up to  date  on  the markets and have  a little  group-think about where we  are  at  the moment and whether we want  to  do  anything or  not.  I will make  a suggestion on that  after we finish with the description  that Mr. Axilrod will  give you."], [3, "Peter,  do you want  to  fill  us  in  on the  market?"], [5, "Just  for  the purpose  of  completeness:  You have had a little action  in  the  international  area, Mr.  Pardee, I take it?"], [7, "Well,  I don't  think we  have  to make  any decisions  on  [the  international side]  today, but  I think we have  to review the  domestic  situation,  to put  it  in  a setting of  the Committee's decision  on the  directive.  [At]  the meeting, we made a decision which  [implied]  a certain reserve  path and we  also made  a borrowing  decision of  $1-1/2  billion, as  I recall.  I think the understanding was  that  if  the  actual money supply figures  came  in somewhat  higher  than that, but  not  too much higher--then  that would, of  course, be  reflected in higher borrowing  from  the  natural consequences  of  the nonborrowed path in  the  short  run.  And if  [the borrowings]  came  in  high enough, we would have  to make  an  adjustment in the  nonborrowed reserve path.  As has  happened after  other recent meetings,  they did indeed come  in high, and they came  in high enough so  that we  did make an adjustment  in  the nonborrowed reserve path as well as  having  the  natural  consequence  of  the  higher money  supply figures.  And we  are  left,  I guess not  certainly, but with the  \f12/05/80  probability that  the  2-month numbers will  look higher.  On the  present estimates  that  Steve gave you  they're  certainly higher  than the Committee's  decision.  But  there  is  a certain  smell  about  this situation at  the moment  of  the money supply perhaps  coming under control.  I say  that not  so much because  I am so  impressed by the  most recent  figure  of  a projected decline next week, but  largely because  of the  way the  figures have been  coming in.  For the  first  time  this  fall we have been getting downward revisions  instead of upward  revisions. I don't  know why we have  always had upward  revisions  before and  I don't  know why there  is  a change  now.  But  it  has  a  slight  smell  to it--I  hope more than a  slight  smell--that we may be  getting  some stability here.  So  there  is  a chance  that we have in  that  sense done enough.  But  in  terms  of  the  Committee  decision we made  at  the meeting--I  forget,  has  it  been modified since  the meeting?"], [9, "Yes,  it  was  modified once  since  the  meeting.  So we  have that  18  percent  limit  [on  the  funds  rate]  in any event.  And at  the moment  that  is  in  jeopardy.  Clearly,  the Desk doesn't  have much maneuvering room--or  any maneuvering  room if  that [limit were viewed]  literally.  What  I would  suggest  in this  somewhat uncertain situation is  that we  in effect  temporize  for  the moment and not  make a decision  to  change  that  limit.  We might have  to  do  that, or  at  least  review  it,  next  week.  But  for  the moment  I would propose that  the Desk be extended  an understanding that,  in  the  immediate wake of  the  discount  rate change,  it  has  whatever maneuvering room  it  feels is  necessary to  keep on  the path--with the  hope  that  that will  not mean  a much higher  federal  funds  rate  than where  it  has  been, certainly not higher  than the  20  percent area.  But  I can't  guarantee anything.  Then we  will  see,  looking  a week from now when we  will have another week's  preliminary figures  on the  money supply, whether  it  is really desirable  and necessary or not  to  operate within that constraint  of  the  18  percent  limit.  Now, the  figure  that Steve  gave you is  a projection  for  December.  If  I recall  correctly, it  assumes  a pretty big  increase  in the money supply in  the  week of  the  10th.  We  have no  data on  that whatsoever.  That's  just  a reflection of  the belief  that  every other month recently has  had a big  increase  in  the money  supply at  the beginning of  the month and  that  a cautious  projection better  assume that.  But  we really have no  specific  information on  it.  And if we're really getting  a turn  in  things here, maybe that  figure will  not come in  so high,  and then  the  December  estimate would look  quite different. I obviously don't  know that  now, but  that  is  a  factor  in my mind in suggesting  that we not make  a permanent  type  of  change  in the  upper limit.  It's  not very permanent anyway  in  that we're meeting  fairly soon.  But  an  explicit  change  in  the  upper  limit may not prove  to be necessary or desirable in  the  light  of what we will  know by the middle of next week.  Meanwhile, the  Desk needs  some  operating room  and we could have  a note to  that  effect  in  the  published record  that  comes out after  the next meeting.  That is,  in  the wake of  the  discount  rate change  the Committee had a  consultation about  the  immediate consequences  in  the money market  and agreed  that  during  the period of immediate  reaction  the  Desk  should have  sufficient  operating  leeway to conduct  its  operations without being constrained by the  18  percent rate, pending  further  consultation.  The  implication  is  that we will come  down to  the  18  percent  limit  in  the  latter part  of next week if  \f12/05/80  we do not by  that  time make an explicit  decision to  change  [the limit].  I haven't gotten precise here,  but  that  is  the  substance of what  seems  to  me  appropriate  at  the moment.  I might  just  add one further  thought.  If  the money supply  figure  came  in very low  for  the weeks  that we  don't  know anything about, we've got  to  decide whether to drop  [the borrowing path] instead of  the very decided increase  [we were]  talking about.  It  just raises  the normal  question of whether that  adjustment  in  the nonborrowed reserve path that was made  when it was high shouldn't be reversed  so  that  that's  washed out, which would itself relieve pressures on  the market.  But  that's  just  a hypothesis based upon something we don't know."], [11, "Yes."], [13, "No,  I agree.  I think  it  has  to be  in  the  record."], [19, "It would  take a huge decrease  to  hit  the  annual  figure, Larry."], [23, "Well,  I think we have lost  on the  annual target  on M-1B explicitly,  Larry.  M-1B  is almost  certainly going  to be  over  [its  annual  target].  Of  course,  that  target  technically  is  a little  low but  even  if  we  adjusted it,  we would almost  certainly be over  it.  But  if  we  talk  about  the  theoretical possibility of  having  a big  enough decline  in M-1B  in December  to be within  the  range,  I think we would get  a helluva  lot  of  flak  from the  other direction for  having such a big decline  in  the number  in  one month.  I don't  know what  the rate would have  to  be  [in order  to  come within our  target  range],  but my impression  is  that  it must be  a  10  percent  annual  rate  of  decline or  something like  that."], [25, "I don't  know.  We  are  1 percent  above  it  with  two-thirds  of  the  quarter  gone.  Somebody's  doing  the arithmetic here, but--"], [28, "Let's  finish  this  point.  I am just  getting  some  numbers  and I can  relay them to  you."], [30, "Right."], [32, "Right.  But  you haven't  figured out  the  quarterly  figures?"], [34, "Well,  I  can't give you  the  full  answer.  But  to hit  the  top of  the cone  in  December,  just  looking  at  it  monthly not  quarterly, takes  a 7 percent  decline.  And it must  take  three times  that,  I suppose,  to  hit  it  for  the quarterly figures.  So  I think  for  the  quarterly figure  we're talking  about  a change  that  is out  of  sight.  But  even if  [we  got  that],  it  would be  a decline  like the  one we  had in April.  And everybody would  say, my God!"], [36, "Maybe  it will happen.  Who  knows!"], [38, "Larry, I don't know whether you had  finished."], [40, "But  do you have  an opinion  on  the  proposal?"], [42, "Okay."], [44, "Okay."], [46, "Okay."], [48, "Well,  the  proposal  is  that we  leave it  at 18  percent but  tell  the  Desk it  can be  above  that temporarily pending further  discussion next  week."], [50, "Well,  there's nothing particularly  [in  the  realm of]  public  relations about  it.  My  feeling is  that  the Desk needs a little maneuvering room.  But  I suspect,  looking at  it  over  a time horizon and given  the uncertainty  in the money supply,  that  it  is a question of whether people want  to make  a decision now that  the federal  funds  rate should be at  any particular point.  I don't  know whether explicitly  for  the next day or  two,  19  percent  gives the  Desk the maneuvering  room.  On the  other hand,  I am not  crazy  right  at  the moment myself  about making a decision that  the  18  percent  limit  should be raised until  I see  at  least  the  following week's money supply data, given my sense  that  the  trend may be changing here.  That may be wrong and we may well have  to  raise  the rate.  But  I don't  know precisely how much maneuvering  room the  Desk needs  at  the moment.  I hope  it  is  \f12/05/80  not  too much, but  I don't want  to have  the  Desk unduly  inhibited either."], [52, "Governor Teeters  just  came  in.  Let  me  just  catch her  up  to  date.  The  latest  information  is  that  the  federal funds  rate  at  the moment  is  at  18  percent, but  it had been over  20 percent  earlier  in  the day.  So  I don't  know.  It  is  not  at  19  percent at  the  moment anyway."], [54, "Well,  I would be  concerned  if  I thought  it  was  going very high.  I am a  little  less  concerned  [given]  the  most recent  trend--that  [the  market]  is  [not]  fixing a  20  percent  rate  in its mind.  What  I meant  to  imply  is  that  the Manager knows  the general limit  is  still  18  percent.  And while  that  is  being  suspended, he  is [to  be]  within the  limits  of what  is  feasible  on the  path.  He  is  [to be]  a bit  tender with the  market  this week,  if  that  answers your question."], [59, "At  the moment  it  looks as  if  we have done  all  we have  to  do."], [63, "I don't  know where  [we  were].  You  raised  a question of  clarification, Governor  Partee.  Do you have anything further to  add?"], [65, "No,  I didn't mean to  imply that  in  the  context of where we are.  But  I'd hate  to  say 19  percent  is  just the right  number."], [71, "Yes.  I think we probably won't have  to face  that  question until  the  next Committee meeting at  the  earliest. I think we  are  really talking about  the degree  of  leeway we  have on the up side  during what we  hope  is  a period of  transition here.  It's hard to believe  that  those numbers would come  in  so  low  in  the next two weeks that--.  You know, the optimist would say  that under  those conditions  the  federal  funds  rate would settle in  the  17  to  18  percent area.  I don't  think we  are talking  about  anything lower  than  that  in this  time period.  And one  has  to be  optimistic  even on  that score, but  that's  what we will  know next week."], [73, "That  is  what  the  current  directive  says."], [77, "Well,  I will  explain  it  to  you as  best  I  can.  I think  it  is  rather interesting  that  perhaps  for  the first  time in  some  time  we  seem to  have a  real  split  in evaluations  of  the Reserve  Banks  [regarding the  appropriate  level  for  the  discount rate.] Some of  them  felt  pretty strongly  that  it  should not be moved and others  felt  very strongly  that  it  should be moved.  Some  of  that flavor was  reflected in  our  own discussions,  and  I think  it's  inherent in  the kind of  situation we  are  in.  It was  a question of  balancing the risks  of  overkill,  as  it's  sometimes  put,  against  the risks  of underkill,  as  it  is  also  sometimes  put.  In favor  of  doing it  was  the fact  that  the  aggregates  as  of  the moment  are  still  running high  and that  this  sense  of  things  perhaps  turning may or may not  be  real. Even if  it  is  real,  the  fact  of  the moment  is  that now  the  aggregates are high and  if  they continue  high,  those  problems  of  credibility and so  forth  that you people  keep  telling me  about  are  there.  We are at  a very  sensitive  stage  in  terms  of what  has  happened in  the past  in terms  of  credibility and  the  current  inflation problem and all  the rest.  So  that was balanced against  the  risk of  either appearing to contribute  too harshly  to  a business  downturn  or  even the possibility, which begins  to glimmer  in  one's  eyes,  that  the money  supply might actually go down--and  that  it  might  actually  go  down faster  than one wants  to  see  it  go  down.  That  case is  far  from proven, but  those  are the  two balancing  factors.  And  I suppose  the decision reflected the fact  that  there was  a  feeling  that  there was  a greater risk  of [overshoot]  rather than  [undershoot]."], [80, "Well,  and  I speak  for myself, we weren't  looking  for  any great  announcement effect.  And  if  the money supply  is  \fturning--but  that's  an  if--there's  a hope  that  there wouldn't be all that much  interest  rate effect.  If  the money supply is  not  [turning] for  that  or any  other reason, we would get  an  interest  rate  effect. But  if  the money supply really turns,  maybe  the  interest rate  effect won't  amount to  much because we can  relieve  the  borrowing pressure. That  is precisely the  reason  I put  this  decision today  the way  I did, as  \"in the wake  of  the immediate  impact\"  [of  the  discount rate increase].  I don't want  to prejudge  that  issue.  And we  do have  this immediate market reaction  type  of  thing.  We will give  it  a week to see whether  it  settles down;  that  is  what I am saying."], [83, "Yes,  but  [we  are not]  preventing  it  from  going up at  the moment,  although the market  is  being treated cautiously.  That's--"], [88, "Well,  I don't know what  steps  you are  proposing, because  I don't  know where  the  rate may  fluctuate  in  the next  few days.

But  [if]  it  is  already at  20 percent  over  the weekend, I don't  know whether  [a  limit of]  19 percent  means  that  he would have  to  go  down to  18  percent  after the weekend if  we adopted a  strict  construction--"], [96, "You  have.  The proposal  is  to  take  it  off  with a caveat  that  it  is  treated tenderly for  one week."], [98, "Who haven't we heard  from?"], [100, "Governor Rice has not  said--"], [102, "Has  anybody not been heard  from?"], [104, "Governor Teeters  has  not  been heard from  [except]  in asking  a question."], [106, "You mentioned a vote.  I'm now talking to the  Secretary.  There  seems  to be a consensus;  do we also  need a vote? I think  this has  to  be  in  the  record.

We  can either have  it  now or we can try to write  this down  in  a sentence or  two  and  send  it around  in a telegram for  a vote.  I can  try to  phrase  it  now and we might as well have  a vote.

Let me just  try  to  formulate  something  orally to see whether  it  comes  close  enough to  capture  the  spirit  of  this  so we can have  the  vote now instead of waiting  for  a telegram vote.  I would propose,  in  the  light of  the uncertainties  surrounding the  immediate reaction to  the discount  rate change  and the  questions  as  to market reaction  in  the ensuing days,  that  the  open market Desk be given latitude  to  pursue  a reserve target without  its  operations being confined by  the  existing  18  percent  limitation  [on  the  funds  rate]  in the  directive, pending  further consultation if  necessary--if  in  fact the  rate  is  exceeded in  the middle  of next week."], [111, "Don't  pin me down on whether  the  [consultation]  is Wednesday  or Thursday.

So basically this  is  carrying us  through  this  statement week."], [115, "I am not quite sure  I understand that.  If  you went all  the way and  said we  should permanently  take off  the limit,  then  I think you would be making a real postural change.

Mr. Altmann, do  you want to  call  the  roll?"], [125, "I will be  interested  to  see  how the  dissents  read."], [127, "Yes."], [129, "Yes."], [131, "Well, I don't know quite what you mean by  \"some depth.\"  I would anticipate  a  fairly considerable  discussion that would extend  over some  period of  time.  I think  the discussion can be  a little wider--more  free ranging--at  this  stage  than  it probably can be  at  the  [following]  meeting when we are going  to bore into  a very specific decision.  So  if  anybody has  radical  thoughts,  \fyou certainly ought  to bring  them up  at  that meeting and we can  let our minds  roam a bit  and have a kind of philosophical  debate.  I think there are  real  questions here.  We  face  the problem next year--and I just  don't know what we  should do  about  it--regarding the meaningfulness  of  the M-1A and M-1B  targets.  Abstracting  from  that,  I have  a few ideas  of my own on presentation  that  I am looking at;  it's purely presentational, but  it  is  interesting.  I am sure that  no presentation  can solve  the problem of  judging the uncertainty about M-1A and M-1B and their meaningfulness.  In  that  connection,  I might say that  the banks  have gotten quite  excited about  this decision of  the DIDC--for the  same reason that  we didn't  like  it much--to have  the  same rate  on  transactions balances as  on savings  deposits  for  commercial  banks.  They have visions  dancing around  in  their heads that  all  their  savings  deposits are  going to  turn  into NOW accounts.  And they  don't  like  it  because it  will cost  them a 12  percent reserve  requirement.  But apart  from that,  it  certainly is  going to make  those  M-1B  figures  look  funny.  We may have  to  have  a target  of  32  percent  for M-1B next year!"], [133, "Well,  that  is  one  of  the things  I think we  ought  to be  looking at  at  this  next meeting.  Do we  end up with the conclusion, whether we like  it  or  not--maybe some people  like  it anyway--that we have  to put  more weight on M2  and M3?  I don't  know; it  is  a very difficult  subject."], [135, "Governor  Partee was  just  saying maybe we  have  to  follow an M-1B plus  savings  accounts  kind of  figure.

I would not  assume, obviously, that we have  to  zero  in  on  the exact  [growth rate]  percentage  of  a target.  But we  ought  to  try in  a preliminary way  to clear  out  as much of  this underbrush,  if  that  is what  it  is,  as  we  can,  so we have  the  issues  clearly in  our minds  and have  some possible approaches  for  dealing with them."], [139, "Okay, that's  it  if  nobody else has  any  questions  or comments.

As  of  the moment we're planning to publish this afternoon  an increase  of  $1.1  billion  for M-1A and of  $1.2  billion  for M-1B for the  week of November 26,  in  each case  less  than  the preliminary numbers had indicated.  Preliminary numbers  for  the week of  [December]  3rd show a drop--more  than we had expected as  of  late yesterday--of  about  $1.8  billion for M-1A and about  $1.7  billion  for M-1B.  These numbers would give  us estimates  for November of  a 6.8 percent  rate  of growth  for M-1A and a 9.6  percent  rate  of  growth for M-1B.  M2  remains strong, growing  at a 12.2  percent  annual  rate,  as the weakness  in the  transactions  components  of  M2  has been offset  by strength  in the nontransactions  components.  We still  expect growth  in December,  despite the  very weak number  for  the  3rd, at  rates  of  3.7 and 4.9  percent  for M-1A and M-1B  [respectively].  The weaker recent numbers do,  however,  lower required reserves  in  this  5-week operating period.  And given  the  level  of  borrowings  that we had achieved in [the  weeks  of]  November 26  and December 3, working through  the paths for  total  and nonborrowed reserves hitting the  targets  would imply a level  of  borrowing  for the  current week and  the next  two weeks of around $1760  million.  So  that's  down somewhat  from the  $2.1 billion level  of  borrowings  that we  actually had  in  the week  of  December 3rd. Borrowing on  Thursday, by the  way, was  $1.4  billion.

Funds  opened briefly at  19-3/4 percent, went  up to  20  percent,  and even touched 21 percent briefly this morning.  They slipped back to  about 20  and then were 20-1/4  percent around 11  a.m.  At  that point we went in because, having drawn up these  reserve paths  as  Steve described, we had  a need for  reserves  in  this week.  We put in  some  repurchase agreement  funds over  the weekend.  We had some difference between the Board staff's estimate and the New York staff's  estimate, with New York seeing a larger need.  The  amount  [of  repurchase agreements]  that we  did fully met--in fact  slightly more  than met--the New York staff's  estimate, and we  did that  amount  because funds  were  trading at  20-1/4  percent then.  I thought we were  just experiencing a burst and a kind of psychological  lifting of  the  funds  rate.  Following  those repurchase agreements,  the  funds  rate  inched down to  20  and then  to  19-3/4 percent.  And then around 1:30  p.m. or  so,  the  rate  dropped off  rather sharply, and to  me  rather surprisingly,  to  18  percent.  It  looked as though  the big buyers  had their  demands  satisfied and they were  seeing  \f12/05/80  some  supply  from agencies, banks,  and regional banks  around  the country.  I don't know if  you want me  to  go  into  this,  but I had given  an estimate at  the  time  of our usual  morning conference call  that, given  this  level  of  borrowing  of  around $1-3/4  billion, I would have expected the  funds  rate to back  [down]  from the  20  percent plus  level to perhaps  19  to  20  percent.  That would  still  be my  feeling.  I remain somewhat puzzled as  to  the  latest  drift off  to  the  18  percent area.  As  for the market reaction  elsewhere  to  the  discount rate [increase],  there was  an initial  very modest decline  in  the  Treasury market, with  [a move  in]  the  long end of  the market  of  around  1/2 point and most  of  that has  been recovered now.  So  there's  about  no change on  the  day  in  the  longer end of  the  market.  The shorter  coupon had been off  as  much as  3/4  point,  but has  recovered some  so  those [issues]  are  only off  about  1/2  point.  The  greatest  remaining change is  in  the bill  area, particularly the  short-term bills;  the  3-month bill  is  up almost  a full percentage  point  to about  15.80  percent. Finally, CDs  seem  to be  up  about  1/2  percentage point;  the  3-month CD is  around  18.40 percent  and up.  And the  prime rate,  I should mention, is  pretty generally becoming 19  percent  now,  [led]  off by Citibank."], [20, "[Unintelligible.]"], [61, "Could I  [chime]  in on  something?

The  presumption is  that  we will now [revert]  to  even sharing  [of  purchases]  between the  Federal  Reserve and the Treasury;  [we  have bought]  $400 million worth of  [marks]  out of  the  $1.5  billion authorization  to  buy marks.  The  factors  relating directly to  the  [strength of  the]  dollar are mainly due  to  rising interest  rates  in  the  United States.
