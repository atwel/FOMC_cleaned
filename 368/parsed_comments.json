I looked at  Mr.  Axilrod and  said Mr. Sternlight.  You apparently have a call  into Mr. Axilrod,  so  why don't you  catch us  up and then  I'll  have Mr. Axilrod catch us  up."], [7, "Well,  I think that's  just  a setting  for  the  general  situation.

I don't  know  [why]  that  should be but  it's  a peculiar coincidence."], [16, "I have  an uneasy feeling  from  time-to-time  that  we may just  be getting  some pure misreporting  from banks, where ATS  accounts  are not  classified in  the  right  [categories]  with  this limitation  of  three  transfers a month.  Banks  really don't  know what to  do.  I suspect we  do get  some misreporting.  Actually,  I suspect we get  a lot  of  it;  whether  it's mutually offsetting,  I don't know.  But there  are a  lot  of  elements  of uncertainty.  \f2/24/81  Well,  the  general  purpose  of  the meeting  today,  of  course,  is  that  we  are having  a consultation because  we  reached  the  15  percent [lower  limit  on  the  funds  rate band]  that  we  cited  [in  the  directive]. The  question  is  what  to  do  about  it.  My own  feeling  is  that  moving very mechanically  on uncertain M1  numbers,  in  the  light  of  the  other aggregates  being high  and considering  that  there  has  been a substantial  easing in  the money market,  is  probably not  appropriate pending some  further  evaluation  of  this.  We  actually  set  a  little higher  target  at  the  Federal  Open Market  Committee  [meeting]  this  time than we had  in December,  if  you  recall.  We didn't  accept  the  low path that  took  us  back to  the  equivalent  of  the  December decision,  if that's  a correct  way to  state  it,  Mr.  Sternlight.  In  any  event, we have  a conflict between  the  two parts  of  the directive  and  the question  is  what  to  do  about  it.  We  can  just  operate  on  the  15 percent  limit,  I  think, without doing  anything.  Alternatively, and  I think probably more  appropriately, we  can make a  different  judgment. These judgments  have an  arbitrary  element  anyway.  We  are keying off the  $1.3  billion borrowing assumption we made  at  the  last  meeting  and the  changes  have been mechanical  from  there.  I would propose raising the borrowing  assumption  from where we now are--not  from  the  $1.3 billion but  from  the  $770  million.  We  think it's  likely  to  go  up anyway when we get  through  this  period.  Raising  that  to  somewhat  over $1 billion and letting the money market  go where  it  goes with  that assumption seems  to  me  not  inappropriate  at  this  time.

So,  the  current  assumption  is  that on  the  same mechanics  the borrowings  would go  up anyway based upon  current  projections  of  the money supply  in  the  next  reserve  averaging period two  weeks  away.

On  inflation, it's  clear  that we  continue to  experience very rapid price  increases.  And we  continue  to anticipate  that  the incoming data  on the  CPI  and PPI  will  show some  degree of  acceleration in  the  remaining months  of  the  quarter.

But  Steve  might want  to  give more  background on  this. The  general  situation  is  that we  are  looking  at  a need--to meet  our path  objective--for  substantially more  reserves  in  this  statement week.  We've been going through  the week  finding  the  funds  rate below the  15  percent  lower bound, and on  Friday  and again yesterday we  took action to  drain reserves,  which  did not  really cause  the  funds  market to  firm up very much at  all.  This morning we  were looking  at  a very large  need  to  add more  reserves.  Funds  had  inched up  to  15-1/8 percent.  We  were prepared to  provide  some modest  amount  of  reserves, meeting  a part  of  the  need by passing  through  some  of  our  customer repurchase agreements.  But  between the  time  our  call  concluded and we were  set  to  go  into  the market  to  do  that,  the money market eased again.  Funds were  back at  15  percent  and I thought  I would defer  that modest action  to  add some  reserves  to  the market.  So,  that was  what  I wanted  to  convey  to  Steve at  that point.  We're sitting now with  funds at  15  percent  and apparently a large  need to  add reserves  this  week of something like  $1.6  billion to  $1.8  billion  on  a weekly average basis. The  banks  have large  cumulative reserve  deficiencies  and they  just  are not  acting on  that basis  at  this  point."], [12, "No.  I think  Steve  covered it.  As  he  said,  the  short  rates  have come  down because we've  been aiming  for  the nonborrowed  [reserve path]  such that borrowing was  on a declining track.  So  funds  have come  down  from the  17  percent  area  to  a shade under  15  percent;  in  fact  the  funds  rate  average  is  14-7/8  percent  so far  this  week.  It  is  interesting  that  as  you go  out  longer in  the maturity spectrum rates  have  actually moved up  since  the  time  of  the meeting a couple  of  weeks  ago with continuing concern  in  the market about  longer-term prospects  in  the  economy, budget  policy, and so  on.

The narrow monetary aggregates,  M1-A and M1-B,  viewed after  abstracting  \f2/24/81  from  shifts  to  NOW accounts,  of  course,  have  been much  [lower]  than we had  anticipated.  But making  the  best estimate  we can  of  the distribution of  [those  shifts],  they  appear  to  be  from  out  of  demand deposits  and  out  of  other  deposits.  It  looks  as  if  both M1  measures-- really it's  best  to  consider  them both  together--are  doing the  same thing;  they  are  running  substantially below the path that  the Committee  set.  As you  recall,  that  path called  for  a rate  of  growth in  the M1  measures of  roughly 5-1/2  percent.  So  far  as  we  can  tell, from December  to  March--with a projection  for March that  indicates  a distinct  rise  in  the rate  of  growth,  so  if  March  turns  out  to  be weaker  than  the  6 percent  or  so  we're  projecting  we'd be  even  further below the path--we'd have growth  of  M1-A at  about  a 2-1/2  percent  rate and growth of  M1-B at  a 3 percent rate.  From December  to  date, they're  both  showing no  growth.  So,  this  growth we're  showing  from December  to March really  is  a projection of  growth in  the  last  half  of February and  the month of  March.  On the  other  hand, while  the  narrow aggregates  are weak  relative  to  the path  the  Committee  set,  the broader aggregates  are generally  strong.  At  the  time  of  the  Committee meeting, the  Committee set  a path  for growth  in M2  at  around 8 percent  at  an  annual  rate  from December  to  March.  In  January  and February  the growth  in M2  is  very close  to  8 percent  and we're projecting  a March rate  of  growth,  given the  strength we've  observed particularly  in money market  funds  so  far in  February, of  close  to  10  percent.  So,  if  March turned  out  to  be  10 percent  or even  lower--any number  down  to  8-1/2  percent  or  so--we'd be somewhat  over  the December-to-March path  on M2.  Our  actual  projection for December  to  March  is  8-3/4  percent  as  against  that  8 percent path. To  date  the  growth  is  right  at  about  8 percent.  Meanwhile,  although the Committee  didn't  officially  set  a path over  the  December-to-March period  for M3,  it  probably should be  observed  that  growth  in  M3  has been quite strong.  In January,  M3  grew at  about  a  13  percent  annual rate.  And given  the  data we  have  thus  far  in  December--"], [10, "I mean February, sorry--growth  is  at  around a  10-1/2  percent  annual  rate.  So  in  a sense  M3  is  growing well  above its  long-run path.  Meanwhile,  on  an  average basis,  bank credit  in January was  quite  strong,  but  the  fragmentary data  we have  for  the large banks  suggest  a substantial  slowing  in  that  growth in  February, probably an  extension  of  the  slowing  that  might have  been developing over  the  course  of  January.  That's  the  report  on  the  aggregates,  Mr. Chairman.  I don't  know whether Mr.  Sternlight wants  to  report  further  on interest  rate  developments but,  given  the weakness  in  the  narrow aggregates  in particular,  there  has  been  a drop  in  required reserves relative  to  the original  path.  In  consequence,  the  implied borrowing has  dropped from  about  the  $1.3  billion  that was  used in  constructing the path originally  to  something on  the  order of  $770 million  in  the current  and next  statement  weeks,  and  that  has  been  accompanied by a sharp drop  in money market rates,  and indeed  in  the  funds  rate  to below 15  percent recently.  Given  our projection  of  the  aggregates,  it would appear  that  borrowing after  the next  two weeks  would rise  back up  to  somewhere between $900  million and  $1 billion.  So  even  if  this $770  million worked  out--and it  hasn't  been working  out  this  week--the money market  would be wrenched  by a turnaround in  the  level  of  \fborrowing back up  to  the  $900  million  to  $1 billion range.  And, of course,  it  would be even higher  if  it  turns  out  that  we're underprojecting  the  aggregates,  as  is  possible,  given  the  GNP outlook that  Jim just mentioned."], [13, "Mr.  Chairman, I think  it  would helpful  to  the  Committee,  in pointing  to  the  oddity of  this  M1  behavior,  to  note  that at  the  time  the path was  set  at  the  last  meeting  we expected--and the Committee adopted  a target of--growth QI-over-QIV of  around 2-3/4 percent  in M1-B, abstracting  from  all  those  shifts.  Given  the pattern we have  thus  far  in  the  month and expecting March growth  of  6-3/4 percent,  abstracting  from  shifts,  we would end up with a rate  of growth  quarter-over-quarter  of  0.5  percent, effectively  zero. Meanwhile,  it  looks  as  if  nominal  GNP  is  a bit  higher.  So we're staring  at  a velocity here  of M1-B  of  14  or  15  percent at  an  annual rate.  Granted that  the  staff  in  its  brilliance expected a downward demand shift,  we didn't  expect  anything  like  this.  This would be  a very unusual  result  should  it  stand up,  suggesting  that  something might  give  here, either  the M1  or maybe  nominal  GNP.  It's  not  clear."], [15, "Well,  I was  talking  to  Jim  in  the hall,  and my  memory is  that  in  early  '79--I'm not  sure of  the  timing--when  ATS accounts  were  introduced, we got  more  of  an effect  on  demand deposits than we  thought  a priori  we  would get.  Our rationale  at  that  point was  that  this  made people begin to  think about  their  whole cash management  process  and that  they might have  switched not  only into ATS accounts but  decided  that  they had  surplus cash  in  general  and put money  in  money market  funds  at  the  time.

It  seems  to me most likely  that  both of  the pieces  of  the  scissors  that  we're looking at are going  to  come  together by the  nominal  GNP moderating and by the money numbers  going up.  I think both will  happen.  But now we're talking about  such a very large  velocity number that  there  is  lots  of room  for both  to move  toward each other  and still  not be  out  of  line. You may remember  that  late  last  year we  had  a couple  of  similar conference  calls  in which we  told the  Manager that  he didn't  have  to observe  the upper  limit  of  the  funds  range  exactly, but  that he  should let  the market  tend to  [set]  the  rate  and  it  could be a little above that  limit.  I think a similar  [response]  may be quite  appropriate now;  not  changing the  lower  limit  from  15  percent but  letting the Manager let  the market  determine  the  rate.  And if  it  turns  out  to  be somewhat  lower  than  15  percent,  he should not  resist  it.  I do  think that  would  likely result  in  quite  a bit  lower  rate unless we  move the nonborrowed reserve path  down some--on  the  order of  $100  million or  so  \f2/24/81  from where  it  otherwise would  have been--which  as  I understand it  is what you're proposing.

First of  all,  if  you  observe  what  has  happened to  the  monetary base,  there  is  every reason to  believe  that  there would be  this  flat  movement  of  the  aggregates. To me our biggest  problem is  to  avoid  like  the plague  a replay of  what happened  last year when we  had a  significant undershoot  early in  the year.  [My  reason  is  that]  I think people  are  looking  to  us  to  achieve a steadiness  that  was not  characteristic of  last  year.  If  we  adjust our  borrowing assumption upward,  that has  the  same effect  of  perhaps leading  to  an  undershoot  in  the  long pull.  I  just  think  that we  \f2/24/81  should  reduce  the  lower  limit  of  the  fed  funds  range and provide whatever  reserves  are necessary to  avoid a downward movement  like  the one  that  occurred last  year in  such a damaging way."], [78, "Would you repeat  that, please?"], [104, "Paul,  this  is  Larry Roos.  I urge  you  to  take  some  formal  action because  I feel  strongly  opposed  to what  everybody  is agreeing  to  today.

We  have  these  aggregates  [unintelligible]  have dropped from  about  a 14  percent  growth rate  over  many months  to  zero  recently.

I agree  with  the  substance  of  your analysis  of  the  situation and  the  bottom line  of  your  recommendation.

And then we could consult  again.  As  I  remember  the  discussion at  our  last  FOMC meeting,  even though  it  never got  into  the  directive as  such,  there was  some  feeling  in  the group  that  it  would be appropriate  to  permit some  undershooting  in  view of  the  overshooting  in  the  second half  of last  year.
