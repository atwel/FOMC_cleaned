{"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER": [[1, "Why don't you bring us  up  to date, Mr.  Axilrod."], [3, "And you have a downward revision for  last  week."], [7, "And the published figure  for the  26th was  what?"], [9, "What are  the November  figures?"], [11, "For M-1A and B?"], [13, "I think  it  would be  correct  [to  say]  with those M-1A and M-1B ranges  that  they would both be about  1/2  percent above for  the  year."], [15, "On  the  international  batting average,  that  probably puts us  at  the  top."], [17, "Mr.  Sternlight,  do you want  to add  anything about  the  market?"], [19, "Mr. Truman, do  you want  to  review  international  markets briefly?  Or  Mr.  Pardee  can do  it.  I'm  sorry, I forgot  [you were  here  since we're]  on  the  telephone.  Out  of  sight, out  of  mind.  Mr.  Pardee."], [21, "I would only add, as was  implied by some of  these  other  comments,  that  I think it  goes  beyond that.  There  is somewhat  of  a  \"fin de  guerre\"  developing  in some  markets, reflected in part  in  commodity markets.  We  have  such  a strong  and stable  system of financing commodities  and commodity speculation now that when  the price  declines  and retraces  in  a week the  price  increase  of  the previous three  months, people wonder whether  [investors]  can meet margin calls.  And they are  substantial.  All  sorts  of  rumors-- unwarranted rumors  I trust--began floating around  those  markets yesterday.  The  gold market,  as  you know,  is  down  substantially in  the face of  the  Polish news  and continuing unrest  in  the  Middle East  and all  the  rest--factors  that we  ordinarily  think would raise  the  gold price.  And commodity markets  are down basically by  limit amounts  in successive  days  across  the  board.  I think  it's  also  fair  to  say with all  this  [churning]  in  the money market,  that  the  banks  are beginning to  get  a little  worried.  I don't  think a bank  is  [unintelligible] alone  for months.  They are all  beginning to wonder where  they are. This movement  in  the  CD market reflects a rather sudden  concern as  to whether they really can  fund  themselves and  they want  to  take  out  a little insurance.  But  the market  rates have  a certain  life  of  their own at  this  point--or  did up  to  this morning  anyway--reflecting psychology  rather than  the  normal relationships that  one would expect between borrowings and federal  funds  rates  and other  rates.  There is a lot  of  talk about  the prime rate  at  the moment.  Of  course, with this  rapid movement  in  short-term rates,  it  is  below its  normal relationship with market  rates by a significant amount.  I don't  know whether  the  banks will  [hold]  off  on  changes  for a while, pending some feeling  [that  things will]  settle down, or whether  they will  be impelled by  their current  fears  to  move rather  earlier and by sizable  \f12/12/80  amounts.  I just  don't  know.  I don't know whether anybody  else has any comment  on  the developing  situation."], [23, "Right.  Anybody else have any  comments?  Well, my proposal  under  the circumstances will be very  simple.  We  are meeting next week.  And we took an  interim  flexibility action.  I would propose that  we  act with discretion during this  period,  try to meet  our reserve  objectives but  balance  operations a little  in  terms of  what  is  going on  in  the market at  the moment,  without putting any formal  limit  on  the  federal  funds  rate.  That  seems  to  me  to  continue to be  appropriate until  we see how this  market  develops  in  the  next week.  I say  that  because  I don't  like  to put  a precise limit  on  the federal  funds  rate  in  these  circumstances because on particular  days it  can  obviously move  in  an  exaggerated way.  On  the  other hand, I think we need a little  leeway from necessarily following a fully mechanical  target  under these  conditions  if  the more  frantic developments did  seem to  be breaking  out  in  this market.  Last week we successfully accomplished this  without  deviating much  from what  would have been normal  practice.  In  fact,  we came  out within  $30  million or something  like  that  of  the  borrowing  target.  We  came  out with a higher federal  funds  rate,  I suppose,  than would have been anticipated, but not  all  that much higher.  We were  not  guided by a precise  limit  on  the  rate,  and I think  that  was helpful.  So  that would be  my proposal--just to carry over  for another week until we meet again  on  Thursday afternoon."], [36, "Yes,  I think we will  record  that  at  this  meeting we  just  extended  the  authority given  last  week."], [38, "Until  the next meeting--or until  the  directive is  changed,  presumably.  Do  I assume we  have  [a  consensus]? Oh, wait  a minute, we  [haven't heard from]  the people  here  at  the table."], [41, "Governor Teeters wants  a low limit  on  the  federal  funds  rate,  I guess.  So  we're  11  to  1, I think, without having  to call  the roll  again."], [43, "10  to  1?  Who's missing?"], [45, "Oh yes,  Governor  Wallich is  missing.  That's  right.  [We're  through]  unless  someone has  something  else to say.  I might  mention, as  I am sure  is  clear  to  all  of  you  just  from reading  the  newspapers,  that  the retail  sales  figures  came  in  strong. We  also  have  some  figures,  so  far  as  the survey is  concerned--I  don't know what  the reality  is--that  show  a stronger  outlook  for plant and equipment  spending  in  the  early part  of  next  year.  If  we  take  the retail  sales  figures  at  face value,  I suppose  it  solves  part  of  the mystery of  why production seems  to  be  rising  faster  than  sales while everybody reports  not much inventory  [overhang].  We will  go  over  this in  considerable  detail  at  the  meeting,  I am sure,  but  I understand that  under  the  circumstances  GNP  is  expected  to  be higher  in  the fourth  quarter  than previous projections  indicated.  Is  that  a fair comment,  Mr. Kichline?"], [57, "I think  it  explains  quite a bit  about the  pressure on  the money market  and the  money supply.  I might  say just for  the  record that  the money supply estimate  Steve  gave you for December is  based, obviously, upon projections  for the  second half  of December.  I personally attach very little  weight to  it  at  this point. It  could be higher  or lower.  They do assume an  increase  in  the  second half  of  December rather  than a decline  or  this evenness."], [59, "The  last  two-thirds of  December  is  estimated.  We only have  a preliminary number  for  the  10th,  so  in  that sense  it's  even more  than  that."], [61, "Well,  two-thirds.  I stand to  be  corrected here, but  I think  I'm right  that  the  current  level  for  the  3rd and  the estimated level  for the  10th  is  a hair below  the November  average."], [65, "Actually,  that makes  it  appear  in  this  estimate  that we  are  within 1/4  percent  or  so  of  the--"], [67, "It  is  just  that we  are  in  the neighborhood  of  1/2  point  or so  from the  top  of  the  range,  if  we don't  get  a  big burst  in  the December data.  We  always  have  these  ifs,  but  they  can't change  [unintelligible]  unless we  get another $9 billion  item.  I have been  [surprised]  by these figures  too many times  to  say anything! Okay.  Thank you very much.  END  OF  SESSION"]], "MR AXILROD": [[2, "Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Since last week the data we've gotten on  the  aggregates  appear to be somewhat weaker on balance.  We will be  publishing  today  levels  of  M-1A and M-1B that will  essentially show very little  change  from the  revised levels  for the week of  [November]  26th.  The partial  data  that we have  for  the week of  [December]  10th  again suggest very little change  from the levels  of  the  3rd.  So,  since mid-November we've had about  four weeks of  an unchanged money supply."], [4, "For the week  of  the  26th we will  revise down  [the  preliminary figure]  we have already published."], [6, "Governor Gramley asked for  the numbers  for the  26th and the  3rd.  For M-1A they are:  $388.9  billion for  the  26th; $388.7  billion for  the  3rd;  and  [based  on]  a partial  estimate  $388.6 billion  for  the  10th.  The pattern of  M-1B is  essentially the  same, slightly higher."], [8, "The published figure  for the  26th had been  $389.6  billion and we will  revise that  to  $388.9  billion.  With these figures  coming in,  we have weakened our estimate of  growth in M-1A for December  to  2-1/2  percent  from the  3.7  percent we  had  last week. [Growth  of]  M-1B remains  just  under 5 percent.  We also have weaker data coming in  on  small  time  deposits  and our estimate of  M2  growth for  December, which  last  week was  6 percent,  has  been  reduced to  5 percent,  reflecting essentially this  weakening  in  small  time  deposits."], [10, "For M2  growth the  revised figure  for  November  is  an  11  percent increase."], [12, "For M-1A the November  figure,  slightly  revised,  is  7.1  percent and  for M-1B it's  9.3  percent.  But  this weakening  in the  recent  numbers,  Mr. Chairman,  tends  to  weaken required reserves very slightly.  And we ended  up  last  week coming in very close  on  the borrowing;  it  was  $1,786  million  at  the  end  of  last week.  Taking  that into account and the previous weeks,  and the weakening of  required reserves,  we would tend to have  a somewhat  lower  level  of  borrowing implied from our  reserve  paths  in  the weeks  of  [December]  17th  and 24th.  There  is  some  uncertainty about  that  level  of  borrowing, which  \f12/12/80  might be anywhere between,  say, $1.6  billion and a little  over $1.7 billion.  It  depends  in  part  on  technical  adjustments  that  could be made to  the multiplier;  there  is  some  remaining  doubt  about that.  Two other  points  I would add, Mr. Chairman.  One  is  that  the  gap  between total  projected reserves, which reflects  the  actual behavior  of  money, and the total  reserve  path set  in  the  light of  the Committee's decision at  the November meeting had been quite wide at the  beginning of  the period and  is  narrowing.  Total  reserves  are now projected at  roughly $200  million  above  the path.  And they had been orders  higher at  earlier periods.  The  other thing,  Mr. Chairman,  if it  is  of  interest  to  the Committee,  is  that based on  the data we now have M-1A growth for  the  year measured from Q4  '79 to  Q4  '80  looks  as if  it  will  be  5-1/2  percent.  M-1B growth  looks  as  if  it  will  be 7-1/2  percent, and M2  growth will  be about  9.8  percent.  In  the  case of  M-1A, that's  just  below the  upper end  of  the range.  M-1B is  just above  the upper  end  and M2  is  about  0.8  above  the upper  end of  its range."], [14, "Well,  yes,  if  we  adjusted  for  the  fact  that when  the ranges  were originally set  M-1B was  set  to  grow  1/2  point more than M-1A.  In  the  event,  there were  a lot  more  shifts out  of demand deposits  and  other assets  into ATS  accounts  than we had expected,  [largely  as a]  consequence,  I think, of  the  Monetary Control Act  and banks wanting to  get  into  the  business fast  before  thrifts get into  the act  this  coming year.  If  we adjusted for  that,  then  of  course we  would want  to  lower  the M-1A range and raise  the  M-1B  range.  I think the outcome would be  just  about  as  you described it."], [58, "Mr. Chairman,  if  I may  just correct  that  a bit,  it's  the last  two-thirds  of  December  that  [is  projected]."], [62, "Yes,  in  the  case  of  M-1A, it's  a hair below."], [64, "Well,  it  depends a bit  on what  we  assume came out  of  demand deposits  and what  we assume  came  out of  other deposits. If  we  said  it  was  50/50,  that would reduce  the  3-1/2  to  6 percent M-1A range  to  something like  2-3/4  to  5-1/4  percent.  I may be off  a bit. And it  would raise  the  4 to  6-1/2  percent  M-1B  range  to  something  like 4-3/4  to  7-1/4  percent.  But  don't hold me  to  precision  on  those numbers.  That  is  the order  of  magnitude."], [66, "Well,  I would have  to--"]], "MR GRAMLEY": [[5, "What  are  the numbers  for  the 26th and  the  3rd,  Steve?"]], "SPEAKER": [[16, "Right."], [25, "It's  fine with me,  too."], [27, "I would buy that,  too,  this morning."], [28, "Okay."], [37, "Until  the  next meeting."], [39, "Yes,  it's all  right  with me."], [40, "Okay."], [52, "It  must be  about  17  percent because  they had  borrowed--"], [60, "It's  three-quarters."]], "MR STERNLIGHT": [[18, "Well,  the markets have  had a pretty  turbulent  period.  The money market  rates have been  shooting up  very sharply  in  the  last  several  days.  Some  of  the rates  are  steady  today because  they have been pushing up, especially  for  [unintelligible]  and commercial  paper.  But  they are  steady, of  course, at  a very high level.  In  some  other sectors,  [such  as]  the Treasury bill market  and the  Treasury coupon market,  there  has been  some  recovery in prices-- declining rates--today, making up a modest  part  of  the  erosion of recent  days.  The  federal  funds  rate averaged 18.80  percent in  the last  statement week.  Funds were  trading at  about 20  percent yesterday;  the  rate  is  around 19-1/2  percent today.  It  is very, very hard to  say where  things might  settle  down with  this  range  of borrowing that  Steve mentioned of  $1.6  to  $1.7  billion.  I would expect  the  funds  rate could  stay in  that  19  to  20  percent range  for  a little while, although perhaps after  things  settle down more  that degree  of  borrowing might  be  consistent with a funds  rate a shade lower than  I mentioned.  \f12/12/80"]], "MR PARDEE": [[20, "The  exchange markets have  all  been going  rather  well,  and  in  the last  couple  of  days  the  dollar has  continued  to  rise.

And that  brought [unintelligible]  for the background in  the  last  few days.  We  are hearing, however,  that  a number of  U.S. corporations,  instead of selling  [foreign]  currencies  to buy dollars  for  their year-end [repatriation]  of  funds,  are  borrowing dollars  in  the  Euromarket  and using  that  as  a mechanism to  bring  funds  home.  This  [reflects]  the expectation that  the exchange  rate won't  be  so high  for  the dollar after the year-end.  But  they are  adding pressure  to  these Eurodollar markets;  in  one month the Eurodollar  rate went  as  high as  24  percent-- that was  this  morning  in  the early hours.
