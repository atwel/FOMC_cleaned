{"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER": [[1, "I hope we  can be relatively brief  this  morning, but  I thought it  might be  a good  idea  to  touch base.  I hope to be  out  next week and  the beginning of  the  following  week, and in fact we're going  to  have a paucity of Governors  in Washington during part  of  that period.  But we  have Mr. Schultz eating lunch  at  the table  in preparation for  leaving this  afternoon so  that  he will be here with  full  strength next week and able to  take  care of  all problems.  Apart  from  some prospective absences,  we've obviously had  some  big changes in  the money figures  and  I just wanted to run over the  consequences of  those changes  for  the  targets  and what the projections  are.  I assume,  as  always,  that our projections are both unbiased and not very reliable.  They don't necessarily show quite  as frightening a picture as  the  most recent numbers  suggest;  the  recent numbers  are not  very good.  Maybe Mr. Ettin can go  over where we stand--what we  are publishing this  afternoon, so  far  as  we know at  the moment--and what  the outlook  is  as  he  sees  it."], [4, "Could you hear me  all  that  easily?"], [6, "We'll  get Mr. Ettin to  a different  station  [and microphone]."], [11, "Let me  say just  one  other  thing:  What  \f8/22/80  obviously partial  and not very reliable data we have  for the  week of the  20th  indicate a decline  of  $1  to  $1-1/2  billion, so  that  September figure  is  not projecting  anything  startling  other  than some mild increase  from a lower  level  that we would have  reached at  the  end of August.  It's not  out  of the  clear blue  sky in  that  sense.  It  doesn't require  any heroic  assumptions  as  to what  happens  in  September;  it just  says  September will  increase a little from what we now  think the latter part  of August  will be.  So  what falls  out  of  that  is practically an unchanged September on a daily average  basis. Obviously these August  figures  look very big;  if we  could put any weight  on  the  September  figure--and  obviously we can't  put all  that much weight  on it--the  two months together are  not all  that startlingly above what we were  talking about.  I have  those  figures here  someplace."], [13, "Yes,  that's  right.  [For  the  third  quarter]  M-1B is  a little  less  than  9-1/2  percent  as  against  [the Committee's  objective of  about]  8 percent.  And M2  is  practically what we  said  on  these  projections.  M2 has  been running  a little  low relative to  the  other numbers--it was  running high as  you recall  and we  had some discussion of  it--partly because growth  in money market funds has  turned negative now.  So we're  very close  on  these projections  to  the M2  target  for  this  quarter.  For M-1A and M-1B we're  clearly above,  but  it's not  by any means  out  of  sight  [even with]  the  August  figure,  if  the  September number  is  more or  less right.  What  this  implies  for reserve  targeting,  as  we discussed at  the meeting, is  that  of  course  the borrowings  go  up.  The path has not been worked out  in  any detail;  it  is  complicated by the  fact  that we had a substantial miss  in the  last week, which meant we had more nonborrowed reserves  than we  thought we  had and less borrowings on the other  side.  So  there's  a judgmental  question on  the path as  to whether  to  let  that bygone be  a bygone  or whether mechanically  to make up  for  it  in  the  rest  of  the period.  In  any event  whatever adjustment we make, we would expect  the  borrowings to  go up  and they really haven't  gone  up yet.  But  the market has  certainly been anticipating some  tightening and it's  a question of  how much the  markets  are  going to  react  to  these  figures  today.  Peter may want  to  comment on  that. My sense  of  it  is  that  the  figures  aren't  going  to make them happy, but  I don't know.  I'm not  sure  they are  so  bad  that  it will provoke a big further  adjustment.  Peter,  do you have some  comment  on  that?"], [15, "I don't  know whether Mr.  Kichline wants  to  report  on any  economic data we have had in  the  past week.  We had  a consumer price  index this morning, which you probably all  know about."], [17, "We, of  course,  had a bad producer price  index.  That was  since  the meeting, wasn't  it?"], [19, "Having that big  increase  in producer  prices  didn't help the market, obviously.  Market participants may be looking  at  that more  than  the  consumer prices because  they can dismiss the  consumer price  number as  a mortgage phenomenon.  But  the  consumer price  index did not  look too  bad outside  the mortgage  area.  As  I remember  it  was  0.6  outside--"], [21, "Well, we have had a very substantial  adjustment  in  the  longer-term rate area  and, of  course, we've had an adjustment  in  the  short-term rate  area,  too.  I don't have  the  figures in  front  of  me,  but my impression  is  that  the  adjustment  in  long-term rates  is  as  big or  bigger  than the  adjustment in  short-term rates, which is  somewhat  of  an abnormal  experience.  We have  essentially an unchanged economic  situation  from what we  thought  before.  I would just  say  that  I feel  a little  sensitive about  the  manner  in which we  conduct our  open market operations.  [I'm talking] not  in terms of  anything we've  done which needed  to  be done, but  I think  we  should try  to  avoid resolving  any doubts  on the  side  of taking  overt  action in the  market at  a time when  the market  is  already very sensitive--if we  can get by with  it  consistent with the  path. Just  as  a matter of judging hourly operations  or daily operations--but it's  a tricky business--I  wouldn't want  to  see  any unnecessary messages  sent  to  the market,  consistent with the  kind of  path and  the anticipation of higher borrowings  that we have.  The discount rate,  of course,  is  at  10  percent.  And with this  level  of  borrowings  one would expect--as with any significant level  of  borrowings, which we  are certainly looking  for--that  the  funds rate would normally trade  above the  discount rate.  I think  that's  the prospect we  face  based upon the information we  know at  the moment.  How much of  that has been discounted in  the market,  I don't  know.  I don't  know whether  anybody else has any comments  they want  to make at  this point."], [23, "Fred  is  just  saying  that we  did, after  a relatively short  debate  and purely because of  the potential  confusion involved,  accept  the proposals we had  from several Reserve Banks  to  \f8/22/80  conform  this  ineligible paper  discount rate  to the regular  discount rate  on September  1st.  The announcement  will present  this  as  an action taken  to bring  those rates  in  conformity in the  light  of  the authority  and the  basic  intention implied by  the Monetary Control  Act. In Mr.  Coyne's professional  judgment,  it  will get no attention  in  the press.  We will  see."], [25, "By  \"overshoot\" you mean the  error in  the  nonborrowed reserve  figure,  I assume?"], [27, "That  probably falls  into an area of  some  discretion.  It  amounts  to  something like  $70 million when averaged over  the  remaining weeks,  so we're not  talking about a huge number. But  I would be  inclined not  to be very eager  to  make up  for  that overshoot depending upon whether we  overtly had to  take  it  out  or  not. That  would be my  judgment.  In  other words,  if  it made  the difference between going  into  the market  overtly, particularly  in  an atmosphere where the market  is  already weak,  I would swallow  it.  If  the market makes it  up  itself without us--because  that's  the way the operating factors  are going--then  it would be  okay.  That  judgment has  to be made almost  from day to  day, but  that's  the way I would look at  it, Larry."], [29, "Where did the  reserves  come  from to  support  the money supply increase?  They didn't  come  from anywhere. That's the  trouble.  We have  a lagged reserve  accounting system  and no reserves  are needed to  support  it  in  the  first  instance.  So what we're basically  talking about  is  how many of  those reserves have  to come out  of borrowing  now that  it's  effective  in  the market,  I guess this week.  We're  saying that  those reserves basically have  to  come out  of borrowing.  That  is  the  normal path assumption:  That  those additional  reserves will  come  out  of borrowing.  Now, what will happen to  excess reserves  and whether we will  get  another error  or whatever [is  another question],  but  the normal  [assumption  in  terms]  of  the path  is  that  those  reserves  come  out of  borrowing.  The reason  the reserve miss was  in the most recent week, not  the week when the money supply went  [up]--was  that  the week before  that they had to  put up the reserves  for  the money supply increase.  Well,  I don't know, I get mixed up  regarding  the particular weeks, but  the  reserve miss was not in the week that  the money supply increased.  And  it was  due  to float on the last  day."], [31, "We would expect  it  to be  up, based upon  what we  know now."], [33, "What  is  the rate now, 10-1/4 percent?"], [35, "I suppose  it  could go up  in  the  neighborhood of  a percentage point under normal  relationships."], [37, "Yes.  As you know, these  are  not very  close relationships, but  that's  the average  implication I guess.  All I am saying  is  that  it's  one  thing if  that  [increase]  seems  to  be happening kind of  normally.  I don't particularly want  to give  the market the  idea  that we have a higher funds  rate  target.  That's  the point."], [39, "I'm not responding  to your  direct  question, Larry, but  let me ask a different  question, which is somewhat related.  It  is  very troublesome  to  me, and  I am sure  to other people,  that  the money supply can  jump up by $9 or  $10  billion in a week the way  it  [apparently has  recently].  That  is  a monthly increase  in the money supply that's  half  the normal  increase  for a whole year.  And nobody knows  why.  I have gotten no  enlightenment on it  either.  Well,  we  think some  of  it may have been due  to  social security payments, but  the  staff presumably tried  to  adjust  for  that in  the seasonal.  So  even there,  [though]  we know the  social  security payment has  an  impact  on  the money  supply it  is  not  clear  that  that wasn't adjusted out.  We haven't had much guidance here.  I haven't heard any  reasons  from the  experts  in New York and  I haven't heard any plausible explanations  from the market.  Here  we have, as  I say,  a money  supply increase in a week that's  equal  to  roughly half  of  the normal  increase for a year,  and nobody  in  the world seems  to  have even much of  a speculation as  to what  is  going on, what  caused it,  and whether  it's [temporary].  Well,  we have  some sense  that  it  is  temporary;  we naturally think  it  tends  to be  temporary  simply because  it's  so big. And the  most  recent data  somewhat  confirm that,  at  least  in a partial sense.  All  I am saying  is that  if  anybody has  any acute  insights  as to what has  been going on  in the  last  few weeks,  I would be very interested in hearing  them."], [44, "We have  only two  chairs  from which anybody  out  there  can hear anything,  apparently."], [46, "Yes.  Let  me go  over  those  numbers,  Lyle, because I meant  to  do  it  and  I forgot.  I described it.  I said  that if  the  September  forecast is  right,  with all  its  uncertainty,  [money supply  growth]  is  not widely out  [of  line]  with what we were  talking about  at  the Committee meeting.  But  if we  look at  it  on  an annual basis  in terms  of  the  targets--if we take  the August number  that we now have, which  should be becoming a reasonably good number, and  if  we put any weight  on  the preliminary numbers  we have  for  the next  week-- we're hovering around the  lower  end of  the range  on M-1A.  On M-1B we're  clearly above  the middle;  if  the  September  figure came  out  [as projected],  growth would probably get back to  slightly below the midpoint.  I indicated  that  M2  was  a little weaker  relative  to M-1A and M-1B but M2  continues  to  be  slightly above the  upper end of  its range.  But  that's  about where we had it  at  the time of  the Committee meeting.  So  if  we  look  at  all  those numbers  in  terms  of  the  annual  [objectives],  while  the  rate  of  increase  is  obviously very steep in recent months, going  into September  and even more  so  going out  of September  it  leaves  us with numbers  that  look quite  like what we were talking about  at  the meeting--with M-1A low, M2  high, M-1B  in between. And M3,  though I don't have  those numbers,  I think is  still  very much in the middle  of  the  range.  Now that  final  sentence depended upon September in  fact not  showing much change;  but even  the  August  figures are not wildly out  of  line  at  all.  What  is  out  of  line  obviously  is the angle  of  inclination  for July and August.  Just  in reference  to  this  August  figure--and Lyle  put  it  in  the perspective  of  the  quarter more or  less--that is  still  somewhat disturbing to me.  While one  can begin making somewhat  plausible explanations  of  why the  quarter as  a whole  should act  this way-- [attributing]  it  to  a make-up, which  is  a bit reassuring in a sense--I still  have some  nagging questions  about  the whole  technique  in terms of  how in  the world  the money supply can go  up by $10  billion in  one  \f8/22/80  week.  Again, that  is not  very far  from half the  annual  growth pattern and  it bothers  me, particularly  since  it  didn't  all  come  [out]  the following week."], [48, "Mr. Ettin is  looking up the  number."], [54, "We don't have  any of  those base  figures  here?  Does anybody here have  them?  It's  a figure  that's  on the  usual table  that  I see  on  a Monday but  apparently it's  not here on a Friday. We  don't have it  right here but  if  you want  to  wait  for  a minute,  the staff will  extract  the  table.  The  last  time  I looked--but  it didn't reflect  the  latest week's figures--nothing  extraordinary seemed to be going on  [in  the base].  That figure,  of  course,  is  very heavily weighted by currency.  Do you have the  currency component?"], [56, "But  it  didn't do anything  in  that week or  in  the  subsequent week, did it?"], [58, "I am sure  the base didn't  increase much  in  that week, simply because currency didn't  go up very much.  What was it  the following week?"], [61, "Well,  I am just trying  to judge whether  the  base went up, which  is  the  figure we haven't  got.  It probably didn't go up all  that much  if  currency was  acting  that way.  We're trying  to get  that  figure on  the  telephone  at  the moment.  Nobody has a solution to my money supply riddle?  \f8/22/80"], [63, "Even speculation  is  welcome  at  this  point!"], [67, "Nobody else  cares  to  speculate?  I keep  wondering.  I accept  that  there may be some  underlying  explanation in terms  of  the  quarter.  Still,  it's very curious  to me  how we get  an increase  like  this  in a week."], [69, "No.  And Ed or  Darwin Beck can probably  speak more  fully  on  this,  but  I have  been told on a number  of occasions  that  the  increase  is  very widely spread."], [71, "No."], [73, "Mr. Ettin has  the monetary base numbers."], [75, "That's  a pretty big  increase  on  the  20th,  isn't  it?  getting."], [78, "No,  there  isn't much relation between those  figures  on a weekly basis  and the deposit  figures.  I don't know.  It  just  is  very  [odd].  no  explanation except  fitting  it  into a broader context.  I guess we have  to  accept  that we have"], [80, "Well,  as  I  say, the  staff  tried  to  adjust that  out,  though  they readily concede  that  adjusting  it  out  is  not an  \f8/22/80  exact  science.  But  the total  impact  theoretically can't be  more than 4  [billion dollars].  And they did make  an  adjustment,  so presumably it  can't  really be  4."], [82, "Well,  I think that may explain  some of  the  discrepancy between M-1A and M-1B that we've been seeing  for  some weeks.  But  that  can't  explain  the  increase  in both of  them on  the 8th.  Just  the  fact  that  it  comes  right  at the  beginning of  the month --and of  course we've had this  phenomenon before,  though  less big  in size--makes  one  suspicious  that there's  something about  the monthly patterns here  that  somehow affects  these  numbers.  But  I can't  imagine what  it would be.  Well,  there's no point  in belaboring the  issue. I'll  just  express my mystification about  it.  It's  a somewhat disturbing phenomenon  just  from  the  standpoint  of  our  inability  to explain it,  apart  from being disturbing in  terms  of  our  objectives, the  impact  on  the market psychology, and  all  the  rest.  But  if  nobody else has  any comment,  I guess we can draw this  to  a conclusion.  I think  the main message  is  that while  this  is  very troublesome,  it doesn't look quite  as  bad when put  in a fuller perspective  as  it may look  to  us  and  to  the market  on  first blush."], [84, "And this  all  is  based on  a presumption  for which we have  some  [evidence].  It's  more than  shooting  in the  dark to say  that August  is  on a downward  trend after the  big jump up.  But  I don't  think we  can say much more than  that.  And  if  that  is borne  out in  September, we will be  quite on  track."], [86, "If  it  isn't, we've  got  big problems."], [88, "Okay."], [90, "Thank you.

I don't see  any reasons  for doubting  the  staff's  view that  real GNP  is  going down at an annual  rate  of  about 4 percent  or  so,  and therefore we've got  only a very small  increase  in nominal  GNP.  If  that view  is  right,  then given the  pattern of  interest  rates, we've had a tremendous  drop in velocity in  the  third quarter.  Given that  fact, we have  to  ask ourselves whether or not what we're  seeing  is  a reversal,  or  a partial reversal  at  least,  of  the movement  in  the money demand  function  that we couldn't understand in the  second quarter.  And if  we  didn't understand it  in the  second quarter, we  also may never understand its partial move back  in the  third.  So  I believe we ought  to  take  that into account  in our  thinking about how to handle  this.  I certainly wouldn't want  to  send  any signals  to  the market  that  we regard  this  as a need  for  tightening up now.  And I would want  to  use  every opportunity  to keep market rates  from moving up  too  rapidly.
