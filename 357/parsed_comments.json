But  that kind of  calculation allows nothing  for  indirect  effects,  for  example  that  an  individual minimizes his  transactions  balance  simply because  he  has  a money market  fund and knows  he  can draw upon  it  even  if  he doesn't  draw upon it  frequently or  at  all.

Do you  have that  feeling?"], [246, "A price  of  $90  a barrel,  if  it's  in nominal  terms,  isn't  even  an  increase  in real  terms  if  these  10 percent  inflation  forecasts  are  correct."], [253, "Well,  I think  there are  a lot  of  assumptions  in  the gas  business  that  the  price  of gas  is  going  to be $12  or  more  a cubic--"], [255, "Foot  or MCO  or  a thousand cubic  feet,  whatever  it  is."], [257, "Not  in  the  1990s  but  in  1985  or  1984."], [266, "I'm not  even sure what  that  director was  assuming with regard to  $80  to  $90  a barrel.  I think  it  probably was in  real  terms."], [268, "In  ten years,  10 percent  is  nothing.  That's  right.  He must  have been  talking in  real  terms."], [270, "Let me  just make  one  point.  We  did  an  awful  lot of  talking about M1.  It  has  been pointed out by a  couple  of people  that M2  has  been  in the  directive  as  well  and  that  somehow M2 wasn't  as reliable because  [its  relatively rapid  growth  implied]  we wouldn't  have had a recession.  I'm not  so  sure  about  that.  We thought  the M2  range was  very tough and  restrictive when we  adopted it.  We  thought we'd be  at  the  higher  end of  the  range  if  we were within  it  at  all.  I guess  the velocity  of  M2  hasn't  changed much, has it?  This year  the  assumption was  right  on the  button.  There wasn't much  [change  in]  velocity.  Anyhow, that's  a side  comment.  While  I listened to  all  the comments  around the  table,  I have  the  impression  that  there  are some  problems  that  only time will  solve and  I think we have  one  of  those.  I don't  think we  should  suffer  from an excessive  hubris  that  whatever  we do  is  going  to produce  a nice, neat  answer  to  our problems.  A sour  view of  business  is  rather  common around  the  table.  I didn't hear  anybody not  express  that.  And  I heard quite  a few views  that,  when one has  to  look  at  an uncertain world, the  staff's  projections  are as  good as  any.  There  was  a certain amount  of  talk about  the  risks  on one  side  of  [the  economy] getting worse.  Let's  talk about  the  risks  on  the  other  side of  it being better.  I think they exist,  too.  There's  certainly a view around--maybe  the most  common view--that  the  economy may not perform very well  in the  short run,  but we're going  to  have one hell  of  a recovery  in  the  second half of  the  year.  A  lot  of  people  are probably operating  on  that  basis.  I'm not  saying  that's  the  right  view, but  it is  a view that a  lot  of people  hold.  And that  probably has  some implications  for  activity.  Currently,  there  is  a risk of  some cumulative difficulty, complicated not  just by normal  kinds  of cumulative difficulties  in  recessions but by  financial  problems  that we  can't  see  very  clearly but may be  there.  We have an  uneasy feeling they may be  there.  I don't  think we can put  a  lot  of  money, speaking  for myself,  on any of  these  particular projections.  And while  I agree  that  the staff  view is  as  logical  as  any, the  range of  dispersion around any forecast,  I suspect,  is  going to be pretty high.  In any event,  we've got  sour business  in  the very short  run.  We  still  have high  inflation expectations.  I suspect  they may be  improving a  little,  but  I get  the same  kind of  reports  that Mr.  Boehne commented  on,  and I  think inflationary expectations  are going  to  be very  sluggish to  change. Part  of  the  nature of  our problem  is  that  the business  picture can move  much faster up or  down.  At  the  moment  it  is  down.  Then  some other  things  may change,  such as  inflation and  inflationary expectations  and  long-term  interest  rates  in particular  after  all those markets have gone  through.  That  in  itself means  we're  in  a kind of  no-win situation.  If  we deal  with  the  inflation  and  long-term interest  rate problem, we  cannot  deal  with  the business  problem;  or  if we deal  with the business problem  aggressively, we can't  deal with  the long-run  inflation, long-term interest  rate problem,  I suspect.  There is  no way we  can do  it  with  the limited  tools  that we  have.  We can get  more  relaxed about  the whole  inflation  issue;  I'm not  sure  that would help.  But  I'm not  ready  to  go with,  as  Nancy was  suggesting,  a  \fbasically new approach.  I'm not  going  to  suggest  that  at  the moment and  [that  is]  a little  outside  the range  of  consensus  for  this meeting anyway.  How favorably this  will  develop depends not  only on  all  these  uncertainties  about  business  that we  can't  resolve, but  on how fast people become more confident  that we  can  get  on an  orderly  long-term path.  I think  a lot  depends upon wages.  I alternatively get  hopeful and discouraged  about  that  depending upon  the  latest  report.  In  fact, we don't  know much.  But  in  terms  of  financial  dimensions,  it  does seem  to  me,  in  a sense,  that  the  key  is  how  to  get  long-term market rates down  and bank rates  down.  Those  are  the  rates  that  are  going  to be most  important  for  the  economy.  But  it's not  really  just  a problem of  getting  them down;  it's  a problem  of  getting them down  so  they stay down.  I don't  think  any short-term relief  on  interest  rates  is  going to  mean a thing,  if  they begin bouncing up  again pretty quickly  or with  any possibility of  that  happening.  And  I'm not  thinking primarily in  the  political  terms  that  Fred  Schultz mentioned.  Our basic problem  is  how we stimulate  the economy.  That may be  expressed more happily  at  the moment  as  avoiding  an excessive decline, without the  threat  of  interest  rates moving  right up again  as  soon as  the economy levels  off  and shows  some  signs  of  life.  I think there  is  a real possibility  of  a turnaround at  some point;  how  fast  depends partly  on what we  do.  But  at  this  second--to exaggerate  just  a bit-- we're going  to  run into  a stone wall,  assuming  the  kind  of monetary targets we have  for next  year.  We will  find markets very sensitive to an  increase  in  the  economy or  an  increase  in  the  aggregates, which normally accompanies an increase  in  the  economy.  And without  either enough experience  with declining inflation  or enough confidence  in  the future generally  [unintelligible]  movement,  as  I see  it  at  the moment, from being very abrupt.  If  we have a sizable  turnaround in  the  economy in a hurry--  expectations  of  a buoyant  economy  and expectations of  higher  interest rates  or whatever--I  don't  think we're  going to  have much  time  for  all those balance  sheet  adjustments  and  changes  in  behavior  that  are necessary to  restore more  balance  to  the  financial  system.  And we'll be  up  against the  same  dilemma  this  year  that we had last  year.  I don't know  how  indefinitely one can go  into  the  future.  There  is  a question of  how confident people  feel  about  the outlook  for  inflation.  Not much has  been said  about  the  budget.  The  question  of  the  upturn in  interest  rates  after whatever downturn we have  is  going  to be importantly affected by what people  think  the budgetary outlook  is. That doesn't  look very good at  the moment.  But  I must  say  it's  also affected, at  least  as  importantly, by what people  judge  our  own behavior will be--whether we're  going  to  react or  come  out  of  the shoot  in  a hurry the next  time  the money  supply shows  a little  bulge on  the up  side,  because  that's  the way they are  sensitized to  think we're  going  to behave.  And so  long as  the  monetary growth rate  is low, they are  sensitized to  think interest  rates will  go  down,  and that's what  is happening.  In  a way, if  we want  to  get  interest  rates lower,  the best  thing  that  could happen  is  to  have  the monetary aggregates  continue to  look low, because  the minute  they begin  to  look high,  I think  that will  be  the  end of  the  interest  rate  decline, at least  in  the  long-term market.  In  the  space  of  some months,  I doubt if  that  can be avoided.  If  we were  successful at  the  moment  in getting a big increase  in  the money supply,  I would not bet very much  \fon  long-term rates  coming down--for  a good many months  in  any event. I don't particularly  think that's  going  to  happen.  There's  great  difficulty  in  knowing what  the money supply  is  at  the moment.  That has  been adequately  discussed.  I would  just make one other  general  comment  in  reaction  to  what  some people  have  said. I do  think  that we've  had  too much  interest rate  instability  and  too much  exchange rate  instability.  If  this  persists  into  the  future  in the  range  that  has occurred  in  the  past  couple  of years,  at  some point we're going  to  shake  these  financial  markets apart  so much  that  nobody will  know where  in  the  world they stand and  a  long-term  investment will  be  three  days.  That's  not very encouraging, particularly with regard  to  the  long-term  interest  rate problem that  we  have.  Something  occurred to  me  during  the  discussion when Frank  Morris  accused--if  that's  the  right word--Steve Axilrod  of  saying something  I don't  think was  in  Steve's mind.  But  let  me say  that  I don't  think  it's  so  bad if  it  was  in  Steve's mind, because  it's somewhat  in my mind.  We  get a natural  force  toward moderation of monetary growth when we get  downward  forces  in  the  economy.  We  get  a certain  natural  push upwards  on the  money supply when the  economy  is beginning  to  expand.  And  if we  literally  [evened off]  the money supply  through  those demand  forces,  we'd have a violent  change  in interest  rates.  I don't  see  that  there's any way  to  avoid  it.  Let me come  back  to Lyle's  point  about  how violent  a change  in interest  rates we want  and whether we really are  achieving anything.  I don't  think that  calls  into  question  in  a  fundamental  way the  trend of  monetary growth  over  time.  What  it  does  call  into  question  is  how hard we should  fight  against  essentially cyclical  movements  in demand  forces on  the  money  supply.  When we get  these  waves  in  the money supply, we have  lots  of  problems  explaining ourselves  to  the  iron-clad monetarists  in  the part  of  the market  that's  [persuaded]  by that  kind of  argument.  But  I don't  think it  is  or  fundamentally has  to  be interpreted as  a departure  from  the  general  idea  that we've got  to  get a  lower trend.  It's  not  a question of  how much cyclical  amplitude  we allow around  the  trend.  We don't  allow  any  cyclical  amplitude  that's going to  raise  questions  among the  questioners.  But  one has  to  ask what  the  lesser  evil  is.  In  any event,  getting down  to  the nub of what we have  to  decide,  let  me  try some  verbal  formulations.  We may have a problem writing a directive  that people  can understand and agree with.  But I'm not  sure--we'll  find  out--how  far  apart we  really are.  I think what we're  debating  is  the  aggressiveness,  in a  sense, with which we move  to  push the money  supply up  or deal  with weakness,  if  that's what we're  going to  have.  I don't  think  I really hear  anybody saying  that we shouldn't  move  in  the  direction of  easing bank reserve positions and be prepared  to  see  some  decline  in  interest rates  if  the  money supply is  on  the  weak side.  I don't  think  I hear  anybody saying  that if  the money supply took  a  little  jump, we  should be  sitting  here resisting  it  in  any sense.  Having said  all  that, we need  to  quantify what we  mean and how we  express  it.  It's  almost  easier  to  talk  in terms  of  the  operational  variables  rather  than  the  targets  themselves, recognizing that  the  actual movement  in  the  money supply over  the  next few weeks probably  is  not  going  to  be affected much by what  we do  and we'll  have  to  take  the  figures  as  they come.  Some  consistency in our operations  as  we  set  them now--not  knowing what  those  money supply figures  are  going to be--with  further  declines  in  interest  rates  of  a  \fmoderate character  doesn't bother me.  I think  that's probably appropriate  in  all  the  circumstances.  I would think that  means something  like  a $350  million  figure  for borrowing or  $400  million, or someplace  in that  area.  We'd be prepared to  move down on  that  if  the money supply is  weak and not prepared to move up  on  it  if  the  money supply  is  strong unless  [it's  extremely  strong].  But  I can't conceive of  it being  strong  enough so  that we'd want  to move  [borrowing]  up, frankly.  But  we would have  to  be prepared, I think,  to move it  down somewhat  if  the money supply remained weak.  Just  how to define weakness  is  going  to  be  an  issue.  We have  had the pattern recently of a 5-point band  in the  federal  funds  rate range.  It's  an  artificial contrivance  in many ways  at best because  if we put  a 5-point band on  any of  these  numbers  I'm not  sure  anybody sitting here would want  to  think  of  the  federal  funds  rate going up  to 15  or  16  percent as  some of  these  [Bluebook alternatives  show].  In current circumstances  the  rate probably  is  not going  to go  up at  all significantly from where  it  is  for  any length of  time.  It  is  slightly over  13  percent now.  I suppose,  on the  convention we've used in  the past,  that would make  the  range  10-1/2  or  11  percent  to 16  percent  or someplace  in  that  area;  but  the  upper part of  that  range  isn't  very relevant.  I'm sure  that  this  feeling would not be unanimous, but there  is  a considerable  amount  of  feeling that we'd want  to take  a very hard look at  this  if  the  rate  got  down toward  the  lower  end of the  range, as  it  well  could.  It  is  probably not  apt to  do  that  unless [the  Board]  reduces  the discount  rate  in the  near term.  I think the discount  rate  is  clearly going  to  be in question during  this period and should be  in question in  terms  of  a downward movement.  I think we would assume that  that move might well  come  sometime before  the next meeting, unless  there  is  quite  a change  in  the business picture.  When one  thinks  in those  terms, we  could begin getting down toward  those funds  rates  quite  easily but probably  after a period of  time.  The discount rate isn't  going to  be moved right away.  Now, as  to how to formulate  the  actual  directive,  I think basically we have  two  choices: We  can put  in  a relatively  low number and say we're not bothered  if it's higher;  or we can put in  a relatively high number  and say we're not  bothered if  it's  lower.  Maybe we  could have  a little more discussion  of  those options."], [275, "I had  Steve draft  a couple  of  alternative  directives.  Let me read  them  to  make  sure  I understand them  first. Well,  let  me just  try this  on  you.  The  concept  is  simple  enough;  the language can be worked on,  obviously.  One option  follows  a practice we have used  at  least  once  and maybe more  than  once,  and I  think  it's a good practice unless we  have to  deviate  from  it  because  it  doesn't sound  like  so much fine-tuning.  It  starts  with  exactly  the  same directive  that we had  at  the  last  meeting, but  it puts  it  in  the  past tense,  so  to  speak.  It  says  that  at  the previous  meeting we decided on  7 percent  and 10  percent,  [respectively as  the  quarterly targets for M1-B  and M2].  Then  \"In reviewing these  quarterly targets,  the Committee  felt  that  shortfalls  in  growth would be  acceptable  if  they are  generally consistent with  phasing into  the  tentative monetary growth  targets  set  for 1982  and as  they may occur  in  the context  of declining  interest  rates.\"  Then it  goes  on with the  federal  funds range.  So,  it  says  in effect:  This  is  the  target  we had set  for  the quarter;  we recognize we  set  it;  it  looks  like we're  low and we'll accept  the  shortfall provided  interest rates  are declining;  and we're not  too  unhappy with the  shortfall  in  the  light  of  phasing into  next year.  The  other  option, presumably, would be  consistent  with doing  something  like  \"C.\"  We'd put  in  those numbers  for the  next  two months,  but  say a  somewhat  higher growth  rate would be  acceptable as consistent with the  quarterly  target set  at  the  previous  meeting and just  repeat  the  targets  of  the  previous meeting.  That doesn't  say anything about--.  What  I was  looking  for  was whether there's  any interest  rate  allusion  in  that  one.  There  is  not,  I guess.  But  in that  one we put  in  the  low number and  say we're perfectly happy to raise  it  to  where we  set  it  at  the  last  meeting.  The other says  that what we  said at  the  last meeting is  okay, but we're happy with a shortfall  [in money growth]  if  interest  rates  are declining, and  it's logical  for  moving into next  year anyway."], [277, "If  you're not  happy with any  shortfall,  you're  not  going to  be happy with  either  of  these  formulations because they both  are  low."], [280, "Well,  if  you  really want  it  much higher--  if  you want  a 7 percent  target  next year--then you wouldn't buy  this one.  But  I think all  it's  saying basically is  that  the number  is  \fsomething less  than 7 percent.

What  it  says is  that  if  we  have  7 percent growth--.

Suppose we  start at  $350 million as  an assumption.  Make  the  figure  a rounder  number and start at  $400  million, Mr. Axilrod.  In  the ordinary course  of  events, you set  a nonborrowed reserve path.  You  start  it,  just  as  an assumption, at  $400  million  and you will put  in a growth path  for M1-B.  Let me give you  two hypotheses  for that  growth path you put  in  for M1-B:  One is  6 percent,  just  to  keep  the numbers  round, which  is  close  to  \"C;\" and  for  the other  extreme,  say,  8-1/2  percent, or  round that down. Now,  if  the  money supply  comes  in  around 6 percent,  the borrowings would remain  at  $400  million or  whatever  the  [initial]  level  is,  if  we adopt  \"C.  Presumably,  that's  what would happen.  If  we put  in the [higher]  number  on  the  basis  of  \"A\" and  the money  supply  comes  in  at that  same  6 percent,  how much would the  borrowing  level  go down?"], [362, "It  would be $200  million  lower by  the  latter part  of  December?"], [364, "That  is  the  range  of what  we are  talking  about in  nondiscretionary action."], [367, "What  I think  I am  saying, in practice,  is  that we might  set  that path, depending  upon where we  start  it,  close to  the  \"A\" specification;  we're probably not  going to  be very quick about making discretionary upward adjustments  in  the path  if  the shortfall  is  anywhere within the  range  of  \"A\" to  \"C.\"  We might consider  one if  it  came in  at  3 percent or  less.  It  depends on what happens  in M2  and all  the rest,  but  that's  what we're  talking about."], [369, "There's not a lot of  room;  that's right.  And that's why we're  talking about  relatively small  numbers here.  We haven't  got  a lot  of  room unless we  really wanted to  push  extremely hard.  Precisely, we don't have much  room."], [371, "Well,  that  is  one alternative  one could  take.  But we would not be  very quick about  making discretionary adjustments.  It  depends upon where we  start  off or what  people  think about  this.  If  we  start off  at  $400 million  and  it  fell  to  \"B\" or  \"C\" or  a little  less,  we're going  to  end up with  $200  million.  If  it  fell more  sharply  than  that  to  well below  \"C,\"  we're  going to  end up at  a lower  level and we may run into  the  federal  funds  rate constraint. That's what  the  operational  decision is.  Now, if  we  set  it  up  the other way,  it  depends upon where we  set  the  initial  level  of borrowing.

The difference,  going all  the way to  the  extreme, of  something  like  an  8-1/2 percent  growth  rate and a 6 percent  growth rate  just  in  setting the  reserve paths  is  going to  be $2 billion,  did you  say?"], [429, "Well,  don't  make the  lower  one what  actually happens.

What makes  you  so  sure  that  the  credibility of  the  System would have  been called into  question more  vigorously had we  tried  to keep money growth closer  to  the  targets?  Isn't  that  just  your impression?  You  don't have  any hard  [evidence]."], [172, "Mr. Chairman,  at  the  last  several  meetings  I've  been  saying that  the  economy was sluggish,  bumping along  somewhere between no  growth and very  low growth.  I thought  that was  a good thing in  terms  of  a desire  to  reduce  inflationary pressures  and  I thought  it  would be good  if  we could keep  the  economy  in  that mode. But  now we  see that  the  economy has  not  remained  in  that pattern. Nearly all  of  the  indicators  point  to  a recession.  And,  as  the Redbook  indicates,  pessimism is  widespread among businessmen.  It appears  to  me  that  the  only question  really is  how deep  the recession is  going  to  be.  My own  judgment  is  that  the  staff  forecast  is  about right.  I would differ only slightly  as  to  the  timing of  the turnaround.  The  staff  sees  a mild upturn  in GNP  in  the  second quarter of next year.  I do not  see  a turnaround appearing as  early as  the second quarter.  I do  not  see  the  mild pickup  in housing  and in automobiles  and  in  inventory that  the  forecast  is  based upon.  I think a turnaround has  to  await  the  tax  cut  of  midyear and  that  it  probably will  be  toward  the  end of  the  third  quarter before we  see  any  real signs  of  recovery.  So,  I would put  the  recovery  further  back in  time,  \fwhich means  that  we're  likely  to  see  very low economic  activity continuing  longer.  In  other words,  the  duration of  the  recession would be  longer  than is  projected.  I'm  also more optimistic  about  the inflation picture  for next year.  In my view  the  course  of  inflation will  be somewhat  less.  The staff  is  projecting an  average  inflation rate  of  something  like  8.8  percent,  and  I would expect  it  to  be slightly lower  than  that.  I was  interested  to  hear Mr. Axilrod say he  saw significant  differences between  this  downturn and  the  one  that  occurred  in the spring  of  last  year.  I certainly  agree with  that.  This  is  a much more  classic  recession.  I don't  think  it will  be  V-shaped;  I don't think there will be  a very quick snapback because  the  conditions  are different  and the  basis  for a  quick snapback  in consumer  and business spending seems not  to  be present  now.  The main  issues  that  seem to  be before  us  then are:  (1) How much  of a drop  in  interest  rates would we find acceptable  in  the  current  circumstances;  and  (2) How much of shortfall  in  the growth  of  M1-B  from  its  target  range would we  find acceptable.  And related  to  both of  these questions  is,  of  course,  the credibility issue.  What  happens  to  our credibility  if  we  allow interest  rates  to  fall  below whatever  level  we  find acceptable  and what happens  to  credibility if  we  continue  to  allow money growth to fall  substantially below the  target range?  I see  our  credibility being  called  into  question much more when we are seen  as  letting up  in a situation where  inflation is  gathering momentum and  when interest rates  are  rising  [than  if]  money is  tight  and we  appear  to  be  letting up--and I emphasize  appear--in  a situation when interest  rates  are falling  and  the  economy is  weakening.  In current  circumstances  it's much more  important  to  be perceived as  sticking  to  our  objectives and taking  our monetary  growth  target  seriously.  Therefore,  at present-- and I refer now to  the period over  the  next  six weeks  to  two months-- it's  important  to be  seen as  not  contracting the  narrowest monetary aggregate, M1-B,  further than we  had intended to  six weeks  ago.

There  could be  a very negative reaction  and this moderate  decline  that  we've been  seeing--and yields  in  bond markets have  the best  chance  of  influencing  and bringing down mortgage  rates-- could be  cut  off  very abruptly  if  markets  see  a precipitous  decline in short-term money rates.

Secondly,  I also  think a funds  rate  range  of  11  to  16 percent makes  sense because we've had this  sharp  decline of  about  300  basis points  in  the  fed funds  rate. And if  it  were  to  drop  to  11  percent  from  13-1/4  percent within  the remaining  six weeks  of  this  year,  that's  a very substantial  drop.  I would  find it  surprising that  people would want  to  see  it  drop  faster than from  13-1/4  to  11 percent  within a 6-week period.  I believe  that the  recession will  continue  into early next year  and  that  there will be further pressures  to  continue  the downward  [trend]  of  rates, which I think we have  to  accept.  My only point  is  that  [the  decline]  be moderate  and orderly or  we will  have a perverse  reaction in  the bond market.  Now, I would assume we would start with an  initial  borrowing of  $350  or  $400  million.  I also  would agree  that  if  growth in  the money supply comes  in  higher,  we could accept  that.  The disadvantage of  targeting higher monetary growth  is  that  there's  a greater likelihood  that we will  get a decline  in  interest rates  at  the  front end  of  the  period at  a much more rapid rate,  instead  of  spreading  it out  over  a period of  months  in a more moderate way."], [258, "Even under  the present  law, newly  discovered natural  gas  will be  fully decontrolled by 1985."], [265, "The cheating must be  enormous."], [293, "We have  a smaller--"], [295, "Chuck,  we  have  to  give  some verbal  guidance on  how much of  a shortfall  is  acceptable."], [303, "I agree with Chuck, but  for  different reasons.

I have  a strong  feeling  that  we're  monetarists  when the economy  is  expanding  and we're  interest  rate  targeters  when it  begins to  collapse.  If  we move  in and  put a  floor  on  the  interest  rate, which is  what  it  sounds  like  around here,  we'll be in  real  trouble. We  haven't  kept up with what we  said we were  going to  do.  I  think there  is  still  latitude  to  lower  interest  rates from where  they are now.  This  staff  forecast has  a bottom  rate  on mortgages  of  16-1/2 percent;  that  doesn't  speak of  any revival  in  the  housing market  next year.  I  think we  can move  it  down.  I agree with  Lyle  that we  have let  interest  rates  swing both  too high and  too  low.  Or  rather we  let them  swing  too  high;  I have  seen  very little  evidence  of  their swinging too  low at  this point.  I think we  will probably want  to  pay more  attention  on the  high side  as  well  as  on  the  low side  in  the  next cycle.  There's  also  a tendency  to  be very unconcerned when rates  rise and then to  sit  and agonize  for weeks  about  lowering them.  We did that  last  summer and  a few other  times  on  the  discount  rate.  It  seems to  me  that we  should be  symmetrical and not  try to  fudge or change  our philosophical  point  of  view as  we go  along.  If  you  look at  this  forecast--and we have  had a  lot  of  surprises  in the  forecast  on a quarterly basis  over the  past  three years--it  takes  until  the  end of  1982  for real  GNP  to  get back to where  it  was  at  the beginning of  1980.  Now,  that's  a very, very  slow- growing  economy;  and although  there have been lots  of  ups  and downs, we end up at  the  end of  1982 with an  8.8  percent  unemployment rate  for three  solid quarters.  That  is  not my definition of  a reviving economy.  And we have 8.8  percent  [unemployment]  projected primarily because  interest  rates  are  assumed to  rise  next year.  When an  economy is  growing as  little as  this  one  is  projected to  grow with no  impact on  interest  rates,  some  policy parameter  is  wrong.  And  this  is  even after  a very large  tax cut  at midyear.  We're not  talking  about an exuberant  economy next  year anyway;  we're  talking  about  an  economy that  is  just barely keeping  its  head above water.  If  we  then  come down and  set  a  floor on  interest  rates  at  12-1/2  percent, we're going to  end up  like  the supply  siders did with the  Stockman article; somebody  is  going  to notice  that  the  emperor doesn't  have  any clothes on  and that we  aren't  accomplishing anything.

Peter, at  these meetings we  set  desired rates  of  growth  for M-1B.  In  the  last  7 or  8 months  [M1-B growth has  been]  significantly below the  lower end of  the  target ranges  that we've  set.  As  I listened  to you,  I got  the  impression that  one  of  the  reasons  for  that  is  that borrowings,  as  they  actually evolved, were at  a lower  level  than  the assumptions  we had made at  our meetings.  Under our  procedures, when borrowings are below what we anticipate  they will  be, do you  adjust  the  nonborrowed path or  the total  reserve  objective  to  compensate  for that  reduced  level  of borrowing?"], [40, "Well,  I was  under  the  impression  that  we set  targets  and then we do whatever we  think  is  [necessary]  to  achieve  the M1-B  target,  for  example.

It  seems  to  me  that  if  we  adjusted upward the  nonborrowed reserve path, we'd get  total  reserves  at a higher  level  and thereby we'd be able  to  achieve,  or  at  least  come closer  to  achieving, our M1-B  targets.  Or am I  [wrong]?"], [42, "But  as  I listened to your report,  I got  the  impression  that these  adjustments  were  very small  and  slight.

As  I understood your  rationale, you're concerned  that  if  interest rates  fall  more quickly than  somehow would be warranted by present  economic conditions,  that would have adverse  consequences.  Am  I not correct  in  saying  that  the only way  to  stop  interest  rates from declining at  what anyone might think  is  an excessive rate  is  to  withdraw money, which has  a depressing effect  on M1-B?

And  \f11/17/81  if  the recession  is  more pronounced, won't  that  cause  interest  rates to  be  low anyway?

I think  that  should be  considered at  that  time,  though maybe  not  today.  I thought  that  you were  really addressing  the  longer-term game plan and--"], [213, "If  I were  to  express  a preference  among  the  three  alternatives,  I'd  lean  toward  \"A\" or  \"B.\"  But, as  has been stated before,  this  decision  is  a very short-run  decision.  If  what has happened  in  the past  few months were  to  happen over  the next  two months,  regardless  of  whether we  choose  \"A,\"  \"B,\"  or  \"C,\"  we probably won't  hit our  choice  right  on  the  nose.  So,  I don't  think what we do today  is  all  that  important.  I do  think,  though, that what we  do  in our  next  two meetings  is  extremely important,  and  I'd  like very briefly to  address myself  to  a  couple of  concerns  that  I've  had as  I have  listened to  the  discussion  today.  First of  all,  regardless  of  the  terminology that  tends  sometimes  to  disguise  it,  there  is  significant  sentiment being expressed  that we  should  revert  to paying primary attention  to interest  rate  stabilization.  That was  our practice prior  to  October 1979.  This  [view]  is  apparently based  on  some very real  skepticism as to  whether the  aggregates  are meaningful,  whether  they're  definable, and whether  they're  controllable.  I've  heard a  lot  of  people  say that M1-B  should be discarded because M2  somehow or  other  fits  somewhat better  today.  I would remind those people that  if  M2  were really the meaningful  aggregate  and were  growing  as  strongly as  it  has,  we wouldn't be  faced with a problem of  the  slow economy and recessionary characteristics  that  we're  facing  today.  \fHowever,  I think  there's  an  even  more  fundamental  concern  as  we  look ahead and  that  is  the  decision as  to  whether or  not we  ought to  revert  to  our  former practices.  We know that  our mission  is  to  try to  achieve reasonable price  stability and  to  achieve  steady economic growth.  As  some  of you have  said,  it's  not  desirable  to  have  [large] variations  or ups and downs  in  interest  rates.  Well,  I would remind you  that prior  to  October  of  1979  we spent  precious hours  discussing whether or  not  interest  rates  should  be  set  1 point or  1/2  point higher or lower.  We  attempted to  conduct monetary policy by targeting on  interest rates.  And I would remind you, unless  I misread what happened, that  when we convened on October  6, 1979,  after  many years of  carefully attempting to  guide  the  ship by controlling  interest rates, we were  very concerned  that we had seen  significant fluctuations,  cyclical  and  other  types  of  fluctuations,  in economic activity and we also were  experiencing shockingly high  rates  of inflation.  Now, even  though we may assume  that  our  efforts  to  control  the  aggregates have not  been as  fruitful  as  we might have wanted,  if you review what has  happened since  1979,  I think you would conclude that  there  is  some  relationship between  the  behavior of  the  aggregates and price  stability, lagged,  and economic growth.  Compare  the  times when  the  aggregates  grew above  our  ranges and  see whether  or  not  there was a stimulative effect  on  the  economy a few months afterwards. Indeed,  [consider]  whether  the  slow growth we've had isn't  reflected somewhat  in  the present weakness  in  economic  output  that we're experiencing.  So,  I would conclude my remarks merely by saying  that  if we decide  that  [what  we  did in]  October  '79  was wrong, then  let's  tell the world  that we're going  to  go back to  where we were prior  to October  '79.  I would  submit  that  if  we  do  that,  we would have  the most  violent upward movement  in the  interest  rate  pattern imaginable and  our credibility would be forever destroyed, because  our Chairman has done  a very  effective  job of  convincing people  that we  are determined  to pursue this  new course.  But  if  we  start equivocating, if  we  start waffling,  I think we're  in  for  severe problems.  These  are some  of  the  issues  that perhaps  we will  discuss  in  the next  couple  of meetings.  Certainly today there  are  a lot  of  people who would  say: \"Let's pitch  out  [the  decision of]  October  '79  and go  back  to  interest rate  stabilization.\""], [219, "Fred, it  was  certainly implied when people  said  we  have  to  avoid upward and downward gyrations  in  interest  rates which, of  course, contradicts  any  ability to  control  the aggregates. At  least  I think  [it  does]."]], "MR AXILROD": [[43, "President Roos,  the  Committee  also had an  M2  constraint.  \f11/17/81"], [45, "If  the Committee  had only  an M1-B  target  and  was  determined to  achieve  it  no  matter what was  happening  to  M2  or anything else,  then,  of  course, we  would have had  to  push reserves  in and raise the  nonborrowed reserves path enormously, with  a resulting drop  in  interest  rates  and presumably more marked expansion  in M2  and other  things."], [47, "Well,  yes,  in  some  sense  maybe  they are  incompatible.  You  can choose  one or  the  other;  you can't  choose  them both.

Let me  tell  you, it'd be--"], [55, "Well,  in  the  short  run our  experience  is  that [growth in]  money market  funds  tends  to  speed up  with rate  declines because  of  the  lag in  [the  adjustment  of]  their  rates.

In  very recent weeks,  the  latest  data show an upturn  in M2  because  of  the persisting  strength in  money market  funds  and, as  I mentioned to  President  Black, some  strength that we've observed in  savings  deposits at  commercial  banks.

The auto  sector would seem  to  have  some  latent demand because  of  scrappage  on  the one  hand and because of  the  recent very rapid rise  in used car prices;  one would assume  that  would have some  connection.  I happen  to  feel  that  auto sales  may be  a bit  more interest sensitive  than  the  staff  does,  as a psychological  factor,  if nothing else.  I recognize  the  sticker  shock phenomenon.  Another interesting  thing to  note  is  that  in the  quarterly  survey of  the National  Association of  Small  Businesses  a large percentage  of respondents  say  that  their biggest problem is  interest  rates.  But only a portion of  those people  say that  the  problem  is  that  they are under  terrific pressure.  A  lot  of  very solid  small  businesses  say that  they'd  like  to  expand  if  interest  rates would  come down,  so I think there's  considerable  latent  demand  in  that  area  as  well."], [176, "Let me  speak  to  what Bill  Ford had to  say,  because  I think that's  the  crux of  the  matter at  this point  in  time. I believe  that  the  very high  interest rates  have been  a primary cause of  the  recession we're  in.  If  that's  the  case,  then we  certainly need to  have  lower  interest rates  before the  economy begins  to pull  up. And  I think we  clearly do need lower  interest  rates.  There  are  three things,  though, that  bother me  a great  deal  about  the  speed and depth of  that drop  [in  rates].  The  first  is  that  if  we  let borrowing  go  too low--I'm not  sure  about  Steve's  frictional  level  of  $50  to  $100 million because  I have  a feeling it  may be a little  higher--we get into a situation where  the  funds rate  could drop very precipitously. And  if  the  funds rate were  to  drop  to  a negative  real rate,  that would be  an indication to  the  market  that would not  be  very  favorable.  You asked Peter what his judgments  were  about  expectations.  The  fact  is that  the army  of  Fed watchers  out  there  has history on  its  side  in feeling  that we are  going to  cave in.  We have  in  the past  and  they continue  to  expect history to  repeat  itself.  So,  I think a very  sharp and precipitous drop  in  the  funds  rate could have  serious expectational  consequences.  The  second part  follows  on  that  expectational  point.  It  is important  that  we get  mortgage rates  down  if  we're going to  get  some recovery in  housing.  Now, how do we go  about doing  that?  Well,  if  we get  more  savings  flows  into the  thrifts,  that helps.  If  the  rates  on all  the  other  alternative  investments  come down,  then the mortgages will  look  better.  But the  fact  is  that  the  thrifts  have been  killed by investing in mortgages  over  the years,  so  the  expectational  factor is  very important  for  them  in  terms  of  when  they're  going to  start making mortgage  loans  again.  The  California  thrifts  keep  coming  in and  telling us  that  they're  not making any mortgages  at  all  even with these very high rates.  So,  how do  we get  them to  [make  such loans]? I'm not  sure that  a very precipitous  drop  in  short-term rates  is  the kind of  thing that would make  the  thrifts  feel  that  they'd want  to  go out  and  start making mortgage  loans  again.  The expectational  factors are  important  there.  I don't  really know how to  assess  that,  but  it's something  to  be  considered.  The  final  thing that  just  scares  the devil  out  of  me--it  gives  me some  nightmares--is  what will  happen if  we do  get  this recovery in  the  first  or  second quarter  and then  the tax cut  comes  in; I just have  to  feel  that  interest  rates  are  going  to  start back up again at  some  point  in  time.  Now, 1982  is  an  election year.  What kind of  problems will  this  country  face  in  its  anti-inflation efforts if  we are  in a period of  rising  interest rates  in a political campaign?  On  the  question of  how  rapidly  interest rates  come down and how rapidly they come back up,  in  talking to  small  businesses  of  all different  kinds,  my sense  is  that  there  are  thousands  of  them out there  that  are hanging on by  their  fingernails  and they're going  to continue  to  hang  on when they  see  interest  rates  coming down.  But when  they see  those  interest rates  start  to  turn back up again,  I think a lot  of  them are  going  to  let  go,  and we  could be  facing  a really, really serious problem.  Willis Winn brought  in a letter  this morning which he  says  is  typical  of  what he has  been getting from businessmen.  In  effect  it  says  that  the Fed is  being  too  tight  and it's  causing  the  recession and not  letting  the  President's program work.  It's  that  kind of  argument.  Now, what  happens  if we get  into  \fthe  summer  in  a political  campaign  under those  kinds  of  circumstances? I just  have  a feeling  it  could wreck  the  whole  anti-inflation campaign and  then we're  in  deep trouble.  I think we  do need to  get  interest rates  down.  It's  important.  But  the  speed and depth  of  that  drop and the  potential  for  the  rebound is  something that  we really have  to  keep in mind."], [183, "Who's  that, Heinneman?"], [193, "That  gives  [unintelligible]  more  important.

I'm not  bothered by the  fed  funds  rate  getting down below 10 percent, but  not between now and the next meeting.

It's basically  \"B,\"  but with a different  funds  rate  [range].  After all,  that's  a consultation point.

I'm  not sure  that  that  will  [continue].  \f11/17/81  right."], [209, "Mr.  Chairman, I have to  align myself  with those who  think  that  the downturn  is  apt  to  be more  serious  than the  staff  \fhas  suggested.  With a sharp deceleration  in  M1-B growth and the  very high  real  interest rates  here  in  the  summer and  the point  that Willis Winn made  that  there  seem  to  be a  lot  of  [potential]  bankruptcies-- which many  of  our contacts are  telling us  will  surface pretty soon-- the downturn may be  somewhat greater  than  the  staff  is  projecting.  By the  same  token,  I'm somewhat encouraged by  the  reaction of  some of  the labor unions  in  the  softening economy and  [by  the  fact  that]  the money supply has  been kept  under good control.  So,  I would be  a little more optimistic  about how much we might  be able  to do  in  the way of containing  inflation.  Now, when we get  to  the  policy issue,  I think  there  are  two  clear  alternatives here.  Everyone recognizes  that we  can't  do much about  the  aggregates  issue  [this  year].  But what we do  will make  some difference  for  next year.  Most  people  have  focused on the  first choice,  the  desirability of  maintaining  our  credibility by not appearing to  have  thrown  in  the  towel  by  overreacting and letting interest rates  come down  too  fast.  But  that  deals with only one  of the  two  credibility problems we  have.  That  one  relates  to  the belief on  the part  of  a lot  of people  that  generally we've  erred on  the  side of  ease  [in  the past].  But  there's another  credibility problem  and that  is  that  we  haven't had a very good record of  hitting our targets. And  that  is  the  one  that  impresses me more.  So,  I'd like  to  focus  on the  risk that  the  continuation of  the  shortfall  in M1-B might worsen the  recession and thereby  impede  our efforts  to  reduce  inflation  over the  longer run.  If  this  downturn is  really serious,  the  pressures are going  to  be pretty unbelievable  for us  to  ease later  on.  So,  I would favor  this  second course  of  action.  And if  we do  follow  that,  it's certainly  likely that  we're going to  have  to  let  rates  fall significantly.  I don't  know how far  and no one  else does.  But I don't  think  the market  would necessarily conclude  that  we have  thrown in  the  towel  if  this  is  the path  that we  follow,  so  long as M1-B  is not  moving above  what we  set  as  our  long-run target.  So,  that's  the way I would like  to  go.  I'm well  aware  of  the  limitations  of  M1-B; but  even with  its  imperfections,  I believe  it's  a better target  than anything else we  have.  And  that preference  of  mine has been strengthened by the  considerable weakness  we've had  in the  economy following  the weakness  in  M1-B.  We've had strong M2  growth  and yet the  economy has weakened pretty considerably.  So,  my preference  is for  alternative A, Mr.  Chairman."], [297, "That's why a shortfall--"], [548, "They'd never get  it  from Henry."], [636, "The only  alternative  is  to put  a short-term range  in  and  I don't want  to  suggest  that."], [707, "And you can  control  that."], [761, "Don't  forget bank credit."]], "MR BALLES": [[59, "Just  following up  on your  comment,  Steve:  Earlier  in  the  year,  of  course,  we did have  that M2  constraint  as  we all  know, but  at  the  October  6th meeting  that proviso  clause  on M2  was dropped  and we  set  sort  of  independent  paths  for M1-B and M2.  It  was my impression, and you probably have more recent  data  than  I've been able  to  look  at,  that  in  this  latest  period since  the  October meeting both M2  and M1-B have  fallen below the  path we  set.  Is  that  true?"], [61, "Well,  in view of  the  fact  that we  apparently  have  fallen below the paths  set  at  the October  6th meeting on both of the  Ms,  I was a  little curious  about  Peter's  remark about  the very small  upward adjustment  made  in nonborrowed reserves.  I think  it  was pretty darn  small.  Do you happen  to  recall  the amount,  Peter?  Wasn't it  about  $60  million?"], [190, "Out  our way we happen  to have  a big worldwide  engineering  outfit called  Bechtel  Engineering and  they've  just had some  publicity about a brand new kind of  business  they're getting into.

As  I look back over  the  last  couple  of years,  we  took very positive  action in  focusing on  a gradual deceleration of  monetary growth.  I  think  that was  a bold action and  \fwe had a lot  of  guts  in  letting interest  rates rise  to  unprecedented levels  in  carrying that  out.  And  I guess  I would be a little uncomfortable  if  we weren't  symmetrical  on  the  down  side.  But  given the  recession  we're now in  and our  guesses  as  to  how  long  it  will last,  it  wouldn't bother me  to  see  interest  rates come  down  somewhat further.  I'm considerably influenced  in  that  by the  real  risks  I see of  this  downturn getting more  serious  than  the  staff projects, although I can't  really disagree with  their  forecast.  But  the  risks are  there;  we  all  know  about  them.  There  are very serious  risks  in the  thrift  industry, extremely serious  recessions--and  that's  the  only word  for  it--in  the  forest products  industry and the  auto  industry, and  there  is  a cost-price squeeze  going on  in agriculture.  To  the extent  that  we  can give  them some near-term  relief,  lower rates,  it would  simply head off  the  risks coming  from  those  sectors  of converting this  present  recession into  a major contraction.  I'm hoping  that  we'll  avoid  an  actual  shrinkage  in  the  money supply  such as  we had in  the mid-1970s.  And while  I certainly wouldn't want  to see  the  extreme  fluctuations  in  interest rates  that  we witnessed  in 1980,  I don't  see  very much risk of  that  happening  in  late  1981  and early  1982.  Maybe  I've  been brainwashed by being too  close  to  the forest products  industry, but  I recently appeared on  a panel discussion along with Henry Reuss  and they were ready  to  hang me  in effigy, Mr.  Chairman,  instead of  you, maybe as  your proxy."], [194, "To  Henry's credit,  I'm glad to  say that he  supported what we have  been doing.  He said  it  was necessary and was what  just  had to  be done.  That was  a pleasant  surprise;  I didn't  have to  fight with him.  But  I'll  tell  you, I do  have to  fight with  the builders and the  forest  products people  who  say  they are  bleeding  to death or hemorrhaging.  They say:  What can you  do  for us?  And do  it soon because if  you don't  do  it  soon,  it's  going  to  be  too  late."], [196, "End of  story."], [320, "I'm  concerned in  formulating this directive, Mr.  Chairman,  that  it  certainly will  appear odd  that we have  adopted the alternative C specifications  at  a time  when we  know  the  economy is worse.  And  that  leads  me  to  join  those who  have  spoken up  in  favor  of alternative B.  It's a minimum of  what  I'd  like  to  see."], [673, "Does  anybody recall  how we handled this  a year ago  when we went  through some  gyrations  in  order  to  get  the  monetary growth rates  cranked down so  that--"], [699, "I've  already  sent  one."]], "MR WALLICH": [[67, "Second."], [180, "Well,  in  every recession  there  is  a period  where one  becomes  alarmed  if  it  looks  worse  than one  had expected. And that  is  the period that  I think we're passing  through now.  But  I think the  staff  is  right  that  there  is  a  foundation under  the  economy. It's  partly the  tax cut  next  year.  I think the  pent-up demand in housing, automobiles,  and  investment,  as  it  gradually comes  alive, will  prevent a very deep  drop.  So,  I think concern  of  a very severe recession  isn't  justified.  If  the  economy  is  worse  than  it  seemed a few months  ago,  so  is  the  inflation outlook, or  at  least  it  hasn't improved.  If  I may go  back for  a moment  to  the  targeting problem  that  Larry Roos raised,  the way I understand  this  is  that  the  Committee sets  the money supply path and  the borrowing assumption.  The  staff derives  from that  a total  reserves path and a nonborrowed reserves path  given  the borrowing assumption  [and]  we then  target  the nonborrowed.  And a change in  the  nonborrowed  [path]  would simply amount  to  going back  to  total reserves  targeting.  A change  in  the nonborrowed  [path]  is  the  analogue  of  a discount  rate  change.  It's  a major  decision and  it  should be made  by  the  Committee, not  just  made routinely because we're  not hitting  the  money supply  target.  The  same could be  said about  changing the total  reserves  target.  That  too,  it seems  to  me, can miscarry as  a result  of  excess  reserves  building up or being drawn  down, and  the  target  should not be changed without a Committee decision.  On the  aggregates,  I share what has been said about  M1-B. It's  not  a sacred number;  it's  a very profane number.  It  has been misspecified.  There's  a member  of  the  Shadow Open Market Committee  in New York  who has an adjusted M1-B that  is  growing at  a 10  or  12 percent annual  rate.  All he does  is  put  in  50  percent of  money market mutual  funds  and overnight  Eurodollars  and RPs.  You can--"], [182, "He's  not complaining.  He  has been complaining  about our excessive  reserve  expansion, you see.  Everybody can find something wrong with us."], [184, "Heinneman.  I think  that Willis  is  perfectly  right  that  the bank  in  Ohio  is  in  effect making  it  possible  to  have  a zero balance  checking account.  And I think we're moving  further  in that  direction.  So,  M1-B  is  highly suspect.  Well,  I guess  I won't say any more  on the  aggregates.  Just  a word on  interest  rates:  What has  been said  here is  exactly what I  think.  If  we  stick  firmly to  an aggregates  target, we're  going to  have very wide  swings  in  short-term rates.  After  a while  long-term rates will  cease  to  follow this  rate race  and will  probably  remain high because people have  the  experience, if  they ever  buy bonds,  of  losing money as  bond prices  rise.  If  we get  a V-shaped  interest rate  [move],  we'll  lose  credibility.  I think our credibility is  really much more  linked  to  interest  rates;  many millions  of people are  more  interested in  them  than  in  the monetary aggregates  in  which, at  least  in Washington  outside  of  three  buildings not  including  this  one,  there  isn't  all  that  much  faith."], [187, "I'll  tell  you  the  addresses  in  a minute.  There are  two buildings  on  each  side  of  it.  I'm  simply trying  to  say that  I think we  ought  to  aim at  a saucer-type  movement  of  interest rates.  I recognize that  we need  to  have  some  compromise between not  completely letting  go of  our aggregates  targets  and avoiding excessive moves  in interest rates.  That's what we need.  And  in  that  process,  we ought to  avoid getting  to  negative  real rates,  as  Fred  said.  Thank you."], [242, "In real  terms?  In  constant dollars?"], [334, "Well,  I'm concerned mostly about  the  possibility of  the  funds  rate  falling below the  discount  rate  and of very low borrowing.  Then  things  could get  out  of hand and confront us with  the  need to  keep  lowering  the discount  rate  in  order  to  prevent that.  For  that  reason,  I would start  off with a  [relatively high] borrowing  assumption and  I would  like  to  consult  at  a  somewhat higher [funds  rate]  level  on  the way down.  Consulting doesn't  mean that  one stops  there.  But  at  least  at  a  time  when much higher  mobility of interest  rates  is  a possibility, we  ought  to  look  at  it  earlier rather than  later.  So,  I would go  for  $400  million  for borrowing  and  12  to 16  percent  on  the  funds  rate without  any expectation that  it would go to  16  percent.  But neither  would I like  it  to  drop  below 12  percent without  talking about  it."], [403, "But  the  range really  doesn't mean  that  it's  being held  there.

After all, we'll probably have  a 9 percent  increase  in nominal  GNP this  year with growth  of  only a couple percent  on M1-B, which  is  unprecedented.  That has  to  mean  a considerable  shift  has  occurred.  But  what  I wanted  to  point out was  that when  Steve  speaks  about  the  trajectory--plotting a course  that would  take  us  through the winter  and into  the  spring--he  has been very careful  every  time he  has referred  to  it  in a statement  to  say  \"assuming the economic projection.\"  And I would  argue  that  this begs  the question, because  I have a certain amount  of  sympathy with Larry's  first  question.  I held my hand up when he  asked  it,  though  it  has  been some  time  since Larry made  his  comment.  There could be a circularity here that  in  effect has  a trajectory to  no place,  or  as  we  say in  regard  to  the discount rate  \"a bridge to  nowhere.\"  That's because,  in fact,  we may find  that the  nominal  GNP numbers  fade  as  we move  ahead.  We've had a little  of that,  certainly,  in  the  fourth quarter  [with  GNP]  being quite  a bit  \f11/17/81  weaker  than we were  anticipating all  year.  I have  a sense  of  a little shortfall  from our  projections  as  we've  gone  through the  year.  We've certainly had big  shortfalls  in  relation to  our  expectations  on M1-B. I looked  at  it  and we  have been below  our  expectations  of M1-B  at these meetings  for  six  consecutive months,  and  the average  shortfall has  been  7 percent  over  that  6-month period.  We've  even been  short  on M2  compared to  our  expectations,  the paths  that  we  selected when we went  into  the period.  In  the  case  of  M1-B,  that's  partly because  of this  velocity problem.  But  I think  it's  partly because  of  shortfalls in economic performance,  too.  It's  hard  for me  to  believe  that  there will  not be  an  economic  recovery commencing  in the  second half  of  next  year, given the  size  of  the  deficit  that we'll  have  and  the  further  cut  in  taxes that will  occur as  of  July 1st.  But  it's  a  fair piece  until  the middle  of  next  year,  and I'm not at  all  sure  that we  can  say with great  confidence  that  the economy might  not decline a good  deal further below the  projection,  [say,  by]  the  end of  the  first  quarter, which could give  us  quite a  serious  problem as  it  occurs.  If  that  is true,  and  if  we hold up  interest  rates,  then  we will  get  the contraction  in transactions  balances  that  will  make possible  a continuation of poor business.  So,  I just  wanted to point  out  that Steve  has  been very careful  every time  he  referred to  the longer-run planning always  to  assume  as  a caveat  that  the  economic  assumption was right."], [186, "Three buildings?"], [224, "Well,  I didn't  say anything  about my preferences  on  the  alternatives  before.  I agree  almost  totally with what  Frank Morris had  to say.  I would choose  alternative  B.  I don't  know that it's  all  that  important  to  get  a 7 percent  increase  in M1-B in November  and December, but  I certainly would like  to  have  an appreciable  increase.  As  you  know, we've  chosen  7 percent  since July. And we've  only had  7 percent  in one  month of  the  months  that  have gone by.  So,  I'm not  really sure  what it  means  when  I say  I'd  like  the  7 percent  alternative because  it  may not be  that  at  all.  But  I guess what  I'm saying  is  that  if  M-1B  growth  turns  out  to  be  significantly below  7 percent--and  significantly below I would define as  being below 5 percent--I  would assume  that  we would not  regard  the  federal  funds rate  range  as  being a  [constraint]  that  would stop  [us  from]  trying  to get more growth.

But we  think  on average  the  changes  that  we've made  to  the third  and fourth quarters don't represent  a fundamental  change  in  the  inflation  outlook, although I would say some  things,  such as  service  prices,  have  been coming  in  higher than  in our previous  forecast.  But  it's  not  a big problem at  the moment."], [120, "No,  not necessarily.  We  have 918,000  or  something like  that  in October.  So,  it's  below 900,000  on  average for the next--"], [164, "Well,  I think  it's  a mixed picture.  A  couple  of  years  ago we had what were  really  fairly  strong  forecasts,  given the  interest rate  assumptions.  Our thinking  there  was  largely conditioned by the  inflationary experience  and a rough  calculation of real  interest  rates.  We didn't  think real  rates  were  that high and we had relative  to the  model  forecast--at  least  our own model--a  fairly strong GNP projection.  Looking  at  it  now,  the argument  is  a bit different.  Our  inflation  forecast,  looking  ahead,  is  coming down.  In the mortgage market  there is  a good deal  of  underlying  demand that's related to  demographic  factors,  and  the  interest  rate  is  a  constraint. But  I'm not  sure  I'd  frame  it  in  terms  of  the  interest  elasticity having changed;  we've  just  choked off  a lot  of  potential  demand  in  the last  two or  three  years.  In  the  auto  area,  our view is  that  interest rates  are  probably a small  factor  in  the  depressed state  of  the market.  It  is  prices  and incomes  but not  interest  rates  so  much.  So, I don't perceive  the notion  that  rates  coming  down a bit--say the  \fmortgage rate  goes  from  18  to  16  percent--as  a dramatic  factor.  Now, if  you talk about  the  mortgage rate  coming down  into  the  12  percent area,  for example,  then  I think big  things will  happen.  So,  rather than  focus  solely on  the  interest  rate  effects, we  believe  there  are many things  going on  in  various markets.  It's  not  just  that  the interest rate  elasticity is  so  high  that we're going  to  get  a big bounceback, given where we're starting."]], "MR FORD": [[102, "In  looking at  your  calculations  of  the  effects  that  the  different alternatives  we're  considering would have  on  rates, I noticed that  you're projecting  that  from today until  our next meeting in December, which  is  a period  of  5 weeks  I believe--and coming into  this  meeting I thought  Peter said  that  the  fed funds  rate is  running a  little  over  13  percent right now--"], [104, "So,  you're  saying  that were we  to  choose  to  expand  M1-B over  the  next  5 weeks  at  a rate under  9 percent, we  could have  a 100  basis point  drop per week  in  the  fed  funds  rate potentially.

As  I understand  it,  the  philosophy when we set  a target  is  that  it  is  a target  and we  may not  always  achieve  it.  We  have a problem now because we've been underachieving both the  short-run and the  long-run targets  on  one of  the  things we  look  at,  M1-B.  Were we  to put  out a directive  that  appears  to  have  set  tighter  targets  as  we're  facing  the prospect  of  what may be  a very serious  recession,  starting  from  a disastrously low  level  of  economic activity  in major  industries  such as  housing  and autos,  we  could  scare  the  devil  out  of  everybody by having people perceive  that we're  trying  to  be very tight.  So,  the concern  and all  the  talk about  how to  couch this  is  very  important. I'd be  inclined to  err  on the  side  of  staying with  the  target  that  we may not  achieve,  the  one we had  last  time,  and not  narrowing  the funds band again but  allowing  it  to  have a  little more  leeway  on the down side.

I'm watching  the volume  of  our check  clearings  in Columbus suddenly shoot  up, which is  an  unusual  phenomenon at  the moment.  If  you  look into  that,  it's  unbelievable  the money  fund transfers  that  are  being put  through by one  our Columbus banks.  I wonder  if  the numbers we  are  dealing with here were closer  to  the reality of  transactions  balances if  we'd have  the  same  kinds  of reactions we're having  to  these numbers.  To play these numbers  out seems  to me  to  be  a serious  mistake  in  terms of  transactions  balances against  the  economy.  I think  these  are  too  low  in  terms  of  reality if we  adjust  for  the money  funds,  which are  growing very rapidly  [based on]  the push being made,  at  least  in our  District, not  only  in terms of  large  corporations  but  of  individuals moving into  these money funds.  The pressure  is  really  very great  to  get  individuals  to convert  into money  funds,  which are  transaction balances.  It  seems  to me that  it would behoove us  to  move promptly  to  find out what proportion of  these money  funds  is  in  fact  transactions balances  and to  start  to  factor  that  into  our thinking  about  these  aggregates,  if this  becomes  a guide  in  terms  of  our  policy.  My  second point  is  that  it  seems  to  me we're  stuck not only with arbitrary numbers  but  that  our  perspective is  too  short.  If  we think a bit  longer  term about  what we're  trying to  do, we  get away from some  of  these  extremes  in  our  thinking  concerning this  5-week period.  Third, to  try to  get  away  from this  damn  base drift problem, which  is  going  to  kill  us  on  the  one  side as  it  did  last year  on the other,  I'd put  this  in perspective by  going back  to  the  fourth  quarter of  '79  and then making  some growth  rate projections  out  into  these periods  for what  it  takes  to  get us  on a  reasonable path from  that level  until  the March  figure gives us  somewhat different  numbers  than have  been presented  to  us  here.  So,  this  is  a series  of  things  that we  need to  think about  in  our policy  considerations.  \fOn  the  economic  front,  I have  a concern which is  not  shared by my colleagues,  I must  confess.  I think we've  kind of  gotten  over the  interest  rate bulge  temporarily here  in  terms  of  pressure  on corporations.  But  I have  a feeling that  the profits  squeeze  is setting  in and that  some managements  are going  to  throw in  the  towel and  that  we're  going  to  have more  financial problems  in  the  months ahead than I think  are  factored  into  some  of  these  forecasts.  I don't know what  the  fallout  of  that  is  going to  be  in  terms  of  psychology [and  the effect  on]  this  turnaround  that  is  projected  in  the months ahead.  This  really is  causing me  concern because  of  the  fallout that would have  for  financial  institutions  that  think  they're in pretty good shape  and could suddenly wake up with  some  rather sick  loans on their hands  that  really aren't  [known by]  the public."], [127, "That's  right."], [129, "Can't we go back and take  a look at  some  of  these  accounts and see  to  what extent  they really have--?"], [132, "What strikes  me  is  the  number  of  people  one  talks to  who are becoming aware of  them  and now starting to use  them.  That really  is  accelerating."], [134, "That's  the  thing.  I think  in  the  last  few months  we've  seen  a really marked  shift  into  this  sort  of account."], [529, "What's  that  going  to  say?"]], "MR CORRIGAN": [[159, "But  it  seems  to me  that  it  all  works  in  the  same direction.  If  you go back  to  the  beginning of  the year and look at  the  spread between  the  M1  and M2  targeted growth rates,  it  was going to  be  2-1/2  percentage points.  But we had  fudged that;  it  was really something like  3-1/2  points.  Now, if  you  look at  where  the year  is  probably going to  come out,  that  spread that we  thought was maybe 3-1/2  is  going  to be  7-1/2 percentage points.  The  4 percentage point  difference in  the  observed spread versus what we  thought the spread was  going  to  be  suggests  to  me  that  the weight  of  the  argument is  overwhelmingly  in  the  direction of  M1-B being understated,  whether it's  because  of  money market  mutual  funds  or  whatever.  While  I'm under no  illusions  that  we knew exactly the  relationship  last  January either,  that  alone  leads me  to  the  conclusion that  I simply am not nearly as  preoccupied with what the  statistical measure  of  M1-B is versus what  I think  the  reality is."], [204, "Mr. Chairman, I certainly would agree  that  the economy  is  soft.  We  even have  some  sense  of  that  in  the  Ninth Federal Reserve  District  at  this  point.  And that  softness  is  well  reflected in  statistics and in business behavior  and sentiment.  My own personal hunch would be  that  the  fourth  quarter  at  least could be  even softer than the  staff  is  now  suggesting.  But at  the  same  time  I also  sense that  there  is  at  least  a residue of  optimism  in  terms  of  the  longer- term  outlook and expectations.  In part  that  grows  out  of people looking ahead  to  the  tax  cut  and  in  part out  of  some  of  these pent-up demands  that people  have  been talking  about.  There also  is  still  some lingering hope  that  the  inflation  rate may be coming  down in a meaningful  way, although recent  events perhaps  have not worked in  the direction of  reinforcing  that.  The  relevant point  here  is  that  if we want  to  talk about  a sustained recovery--whether  it  starts  in  the second quarter or  the  third  quarter--the  sustainability quotient  is going  to  depend  on  two  or  three  critical  things.  One  is  bending down that  inflation rate,  including the  wage  side.  Another  is  the budget situation, which hasn't  even been mentioned here,  and as  I would  look at  that  right now recent  events seem  to  have worked in  the  direction of  making it  harder  rather than  easier  to  get on with  the  further adjustments  that have  to  be made  in  that area.  The  other  thing that is  very important  in  connection with  sustainability is  that we simply have  to  create  and maintain an  environment  in which some  of  these very serious  liquidity and balance sheet  strains that  are  all  over  the economy can be  turned around.  And achieving  that  turnaround under  the best  of  circumstances  is  not  something  that  is  going  to be done quickly or easily.  It's  going  to  take  some time, which  in  turn implies  that  it will  not  be done  in an  environment  in  which we have these  zigzag patterns  of  interest  rates  and these  zigzag patterns of economic  activity.  That  leads me very much  in  the  direction that Governor Gramley  suggested.  And  fundamentally it  leaves me with the view  that we ought  to  be proceeding  slowly and deliberately with respect  to  this  interest  rate  situation,  even  though  I, too,  obviously would conclude  that  there  is  some  further  latitude  that  can be constructively used here.

I could accept  combining that  formulation with a  federal funds  rate  of  10  to  15  percent,  simply because  I think  it's  going  to be  hard to get  the  aggregates  specifications even  in alternative  C, given  the  economy.

As  I  listen  to  the  staff,  they are  telling us,  I  think,  that  we are  in a classic  recession now.  It  is  quite pervasive across  sectors;  it  has  cumulative  characteristics, but  the economy is  by no means  falling apart.  We are not  looking at a  1974- 75;  we're not  looking  at  a  second quarter  of  1980.  I find myself  in broad agreement with that,  and  I think that  is  what  the  tone  of  the Redbook  is  saying  also.  But,  frankly,  I don't  like  what we're  going through.  I would much rather  have  seen a continued  more or  less sideways path instead  of  heading into  a  recession.  If  we  look back at what has been happening  in the  last  two  years, we  find  that  the economy got  too weak  in  the  early part  of  1980  and  it  got  too  strong in  the  last  half  of  1980  and  then it  was  too weak  again.  In  all candor  we have  to  acknowledge  that  the behavior  of  financial variables has been principally responsible  for  that.  I don't  think we  ought  to cast  any blame.  If  I had been responsible  for  running the  whole  thing myself,  I don't  know that  I could have done  any better  and  I may well have done worse.  I certainly agree with Willis  Winn's  comments  that  we're  looking  at  the behavior  of  a measure of  transactions balances  that  we have not  the  foggiest notion  of  how to  interpret.  But  I don't  think the  answer  is  simply to  recast  our  statistics, because what we're going  through is  a wholesale change  in ways  of  portfolio management  on the  part of  both  businesses and  individuals.  And it's  going  to  take  a long,  long  time  for  this  to  shake  down until  we  finally understand what these monetary aggregates mean.  I think what we have  to do  is  to take  into  account  what  is  happening  to  interest rates,  at  least  to some  degree;  and  there  just  isn't  any doubt in my mind that  interest rates have  gone  through much  too wide  swings  in  the past  couple  of years.  In retrospect,  I come  to  the conclusion  that when we  let  the fed  funds  rate  get up  to  the  18  to  20  percent  range,  the behavior  of the  economy subsequently has  become  too weak.  And when we  let  it  get down into  the  8 to  10  percent  range,  the  economy has become  too strong..  Now, those  are rather wide limits,  but  somewhere  between those  two  limits  is  where we  want to  be.  I agree with Mr.  Axilrod's  comments  that  the  economy  is  different  now than  it was  in the  second quarter  of  1980,  so we're not going  to  see  the  same  kind of  response  that  ensued upon  removal  of credit  controls  when  interest  rates on  short-term securities were slightly below 10  percent.  But  let  us  remember also  that  we have an enormous  amount  of  fiscal  stimulus  coming along  in  the  latter half  of next year,  and  that's  going  to  work the  other way.  And I  agree with Ed  Boehne  that we have  a lot  of  pent-up  demand out  there  that  could begin  to  affect  the  economy  if  interest  rates  come down  a  lot  further.  The most  important policy question  we need to  focus  on  as  a  Committee  today is  how far  and how fast  we want  interest  rates  to  fall  \ffrom here.  I would remind you  that  interest rates  are  already  lower than  the  trough  level  of  interest rates  that  underlies  the  staff forecast.  The  staff  forecast has  a trough  level  of  Treasury bill rates--that  is,  on  short-term securities--of  11-1/2  percent  in  the first  quarter of  1982.  We're already below that.  I think we will  see a significant  further  reduction in  important  rates  of  interest  like mortgage  rates  if  short-term rates  stay where  they are  for  a while. It  may well be  that  some  further decline  in  short  rates  is appropriate, maybe  even desirable, but we  need to  be  extremely cautious in how far we  let  them go because  inevitably if  the  economy begins  to  recover strongly, with a combination  of  a relaxation of financial  constraints and  fiscal  stimulus,  the  rates  are  going to rocket back up  again."], [267, "Well,  in  nominal  terms,  10  percent--  \f11/17/81"], [312, "I would agree with Roger,  and I would prefer  the  11  to  16  percent.

And it's clear  that  [just  about]  all  of  the  sectors have  now been affected, with very few exceptions.  Turning  to  the  auto situation, October  can only be  classified as  a disaster.  Any hope  for  1981  at this point, of  course,  is  gone.  The  optimism that  some  of  them have for  1982  is  significantly  eroded and  I think  the  automotive situation, therefore, is  very serious.  Capital  expenditures  in  our area have been  further curtailed, particularly  in  the  automotive  industry, with significant cutbacks.  The Christmas  shutdown schedules, which were already going to be heavy, have  been extended considerably.  This recession  is  a little  different  in  the Midwest  than other  recessions have  been.  In  the past  the  agricultural  sector has  offset  the industrial sector.  This  time  that  is  not  the  case.  Because  of  high production, farm  incomes are  down  and,  as  a result,  the  agricultural area  is  also  in  a very serious  predicament.  And that  has  impacts  on  \fpeople who manufacture products  for  that  sector,  several  of whom have gotten  themselves  into very weakened, precarious positions.  In  turn, the  banks  that  extend  credit  to  the  farms  are beginning to  see  some slowdown  in payments,  and  I think  it  is  inevitable  that  there  will  be some problem  loans  developing  among those banks  as  they go  through  a foreclosure procedure.  I am considerably more pessimistic  than  most with regard to  the  outlook for  '82.  I admittedly  come  from an area where  there  is  a very heavy concentration  of  industries  that have  been most  affected. But  I am beginning to  wonder  if  the  consensus  view  that we will  all come  to  work on  the  first  of  July and  find  that  someone has  turned  the lights  on  is  really going  to  come  to  pass.  I think we're placing an awful  lot  of  hope  that  the  tax  cut will  produce  significant benefits. I think the  recovery will  begin to  take  place as  we  see a permanent or more  lasting  impact  on  inflation.

I don't want  to  imply that  any of  this  should indicate  a significant  change  in policy for  us.  On  the  contrary, we  continue  to have  the  broad support  of  the  business and  financial  industry  and  I think  they would  encourage  us  to  stay with the  general  direction  of our  current policy.  But my hunch  is  that  with  the  economy as weak as it  is  rates  will  continue  to  come down and  we can  continue  to  maintain a  fairly restrictive  stance  on  the  aggregates without  necessarily having a negative  impact  on  the  recovery prospects.

But  I do sense  a clear  trend around  the  table  that  we're  fighting last  year's war,  which of  course  is  always  a danger.  It  seems  to me  that  the latest  Maginot  line  is  that  if  the  federal  funds  rate drops below 10 percent,  the  economy  is  going  to  turn  on  the dime and shoot  up rapidly.  That  seems  to  me,  at  least  for  the  first  half of  1982,  to  be highly unlikely.  Quite  the  contrary,  I think  there  is  a risk  that  if we're  too  rigid  in  following  this particular  [policy]  line, we  could well  end up  with a much  deeper recession  than we're projecting.  I don't have  the confidence  that  that would be  the  case, but  that risk is  clearly there.  With that background,  I tried to  read some of  the euphemisms  that  Steve Axilrod  is  now developing for  the  Bluebook.  I agree with him, looking at  the  options,  that we're not  going  to affect the  monetary growth rates  in the  last  weeks  of  this year.  But  he talks  about  a more restrictive policy producing a  \"smoother transition to  targets  for 1982\"  and  that's  the  euphemism that  I've  been trying  to interpret.  What  I think  it  means--I'd like  to  ask  Steve--is  that we're going  to  have  some very low monetary growth rates  early  in  the year, which would be helpful  in  offsetting very rapid growth  rates later  in  the  year.  But  if  we  set  out  to produce  overtly very low monetary growth  rates  in  the  first  half  when the  economy  is  very weak, we  could generate a  larger  recession  than  any of  us would think was constructive  in  the  situation.  Have  I interpreted you wrongly,  Steve?"], [202, "Finally,  looking at  the  options  for  this  meeting,  two of  the  options  call  for  a more restrictive policy than we announced at  the  last  meeting.  It's  hard  for me  to  envisage what economic  data have  come  in  over  the  past five  weeks  that would  lead us to  support  a more  restrictive policy  than we  did the  last  time.  I could certainly buy  \"B\" because we  could still  say  that  we're shooting for  7 percent  growth  through  the  rest  of the  year, which  is  a number we put  out  last  time.  I find  it  very difficult  to  figure  out how we would explain coming  out with  the  5-3/4  percent  target under alternative  C, after having given our  sanction to  a 7 percent  growth rate  before we  knew how sharp the  decline  in  the  economy was going  to be.  I should  think  that would  take  some doing."], [349, "What we do  in  the next  6 weeks will  impact what  happens  to  the  money supply in  the  first  quarter."], [549, "That we've  gone  completely monetarist?"], [552, "Milton Friedman has  finally won!"], [661, "While noting  it  and  ignoring it."]], "MR GUFFEY": [[211, "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like  to  align  myself with comments made  earlier by Governor Schultz  and Governor Gramley.  It  seems clear  to me  that  the weakness  in  the  economy that we're  experiencing now is  something that we've been looking  forward to.  We've  achieved it  and we hope  it  doesn't  go  any deeper.  But it's a point  at which, if  we make  a mistake with regard  to  interest rate levels,  in my judgment  our  credibility will  indeed be  in  jeopardy. Let  me  just make  one other  observation.  For  those who have commented about  achieving an M1  growth represented by alternatives A, B,  or C, I'd like  to  observe  that  we are  talking about  only  a two-month period remaining  in  this year.  I believe  Frank Morris  spoke  of adopting  \"B\" or  \"C,\"  which  are  somewhat  more restrictive  than what  we  adopted at the  last  meeting.  At  that meeting we were  looking at  a three-month period,  and the  incoming evidence suggests  that we  cannot  achieve what  \fwe  set  out  to  do  in  September  or October.  To  try to  do  so  in  the remaining  6 weeks  of  this period would not  be my prescription.  I  think the  focus  should now be  on  the  interest  rate  level;  to moderate  the  interest  rate  reductions  to  smooth the  transition  into the  first  quarter  of  1982  is  important.  I would also  observe  that  the interest  rate  levels  have been reduced  rather  significantly over the last  60  days;  the  lagged effects  of  those  interest rate  reductions  are not  clear, but  they  are  significant.  Let me  remind you that  as  of  the first  of  September,  for  example,  the  federal  funds  rate was  averaging close  to  16-3/4  percent;  it's  now  at  13-1/4  percent,  I believe  Peter said, and  rates  on  short-term governments  have had an even  further reduction.  We  don't  know what  the  effects  of  this  will be but  they should be positive  on  the economy.  As  a result,  just  to  turn  loose and  let  interest  rates  continue  to  fall  to  achieve an  aggregate  growth target  for  the year  over  the  remaining part  of  the year  is  not  what I would prefer.  I would suggest  a prescription of  alternative  C with an  11  to  16  percent  federal  funds  range, a borrowing  level  in  the  neighborhood of  what  it  is  now, which  I understand  is  about  $350  million.  However, to avoid  the  possibility that  things  might  turn  around  and we  would get  much  stronger growth  in the  aggregates  than was  forecast  in  the Bluebook,  I'd like  to  suggest  a change  in  the language  of  the directive.  I'd say growth  of  5 percent  from September  to  December,  as suggested by alternative  C,  \"or somewhat  higher,\"  thus  accepting higher growth  if  it  occurs.  I think the  [chances]  are  that  it will not  be  that  high.

I think there has been a decided change  in  attitudes  in  the  Eleventh District  over  the  last  six weeks.  We  see  weakness  starting to  spread in our  area.  Of  course,  like  the rest  of  the nation,  retail  sales, autos,  and housing have been  weak  for  some  time.  We  are starting  to see  some  increased  layoffs  in  the  manufacturing area--in the  aircraft and the  electronics  industries.  Also,  there  are  some  early signs  of possible weakness in  the  energy industry.  The  drilling boom seems  to be  slowing a little.  I'm told  that  one  can actually see  a few rigs  \fstacked  in the yards,  and  that  has  not been the  case  for  quite  some time,  although  the  demand  for  the  deep  offshore rigs  remains  strong. We have  had unusually heavy  rains, particularly  in  the north central Texas  area,  and  that  is  going  to  cause quite  a bit  of  crop loss, particularly  in cotton  and wheat.  People  are  estimating  a loss  of about  $25  million  in  that  area.  Also,  we're beginning to  hear concerns  expressed about  the possibility of  over-building  in the commercial area,  particularly in  the  Houston  and Dallas  markets.  As far  as  the  staff's  outlook on  the  economy,  that  is  about  the way  I would  see  it.  It's  a reasonable  outlook  and  it's  consistent with  what I'm hearing.  On the  policy side,  a very  sharp decline  in  [the  federal  funds  rate]  right now would  cause me  a  lot  of  concern,  particularly for  the  implication for  the  long-term rates.  [As  for]  credibility and perceptions,  I think  there's more  likelihood of  serious  criticism  from the majority of people  on  the  interest  rate  side  rather  than  on  not meeting the  stated targets.
