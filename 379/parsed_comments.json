{"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER": [[1, "I conclude  from all  of  this,  gentlemen,  that  whatever people  say  about our monetary policy, our  technology is worse!  We will  see what  we can do  to  improve  it.  [Secretary's  note: The  Chairman was  referring to problems  with the  telephone communications  equipment.]  The general  question that  I wanted  to review with you is  the reaction  to  this  targeting  [or]  nontargeting that we went  through for 1981.  I think it's  apparent after going through  several days  of hearings, not  only with the  Banking Committee but with other committees, that we have  contributed to a lot  of  confusion about  what our intention was  in not  presenting  targets  [for  1981].  Of  course, the  testimony and  the  statement and  the  report were couched in  terms of  working toward some  reduction in  the  targets.  But  I am  afraid in the  [interpretation]  that  came through  that was  not at  all  clear because otherwise we would have  said  something about the  targets.  So they doubt  our conviction  as well  as  our good will  in following what they conceive  to be  the  law.  This  leaves me  troubled somewhat--not  in [regard  to  the]  substance--but that  our trust  and good  faith have been questioned by a large number of  people.  And I think  it  could lead to some  continuing problems.  It will  certainly  lead  to  a very adverse Committee report, but  that  in  itself  was  anticipated.  What disturbs me  is  this  underlying sense of  a lack of  trust  in our  good  faith.  I have  a specific  request  from Mr. Proxmire, which I am now  fulfilling,  to  review this  situation with  the  Committee.  [The  Banking Committee]  challenges us  on legal  grounds,  I think, as  well  as  on substantive grounds.  I think the  legal position is  perhaps a little fuzzier than we  thought  it  was  at  the  time  [of  our decision].  What they point out  is  that  there is  a Senate committee  report  that has fairly specific language.  It's  just  a Senate  committee  report, but nonetheless  it's  there,  and it  speaks  of  \"numerical\" monetary targets for  a fixed  calendar year.  Of  course, by coincidence  that was precisely the  language  that  I used in  the  testimony--that  we  didn't choose to  give  them precise numerical  targets.  So  they found  some language  that spoke  precisely  in terms  of numerical  targets.  That committee report isn't  absolutely conclusive but  it  surely had  some coloration to  the  effect  that we would have precise numerical  targets for  both years.  So  I think our  legal  ground  is  still  valid, but  it's not quite  so  one-sided  as  the presumption that we had at  the  time we were  discussing  it  at  the Committee meeting.  But more  fundamental than the  legal  question, which our  legal  counsel  is  still  sure he could win,  is  that  the  issue  is  just  a little more clouded, as  I understand it.  I'm not  sure there's  any merit  at  all  in  getting into a legal  argument.  In  the  end they  can change  the  law, obviously,  if they want  it  clearer.  There was  no support  for  our position by anybody,  and there was  bipartisan concern up  and down the  line  in the Banking Committee.  And, as  I say,  [the  issue]  was mentioned  in some other committees.  This leaves me personally with the  feeling  that we probably ought to  go ahead and give them some  quantitative  idea as  to  what we are  talking about.  The  substantive problem  is  that, with all  of  the institutional changes,  [numerical  targets]  are  likely to  confuse them. I told  them that 19  times,  to no  avail.  I am in  the process  of  \f7/25/80  preparing  a letter that will  go  to  both committees,  if  we want  to  go this way.  It  starts  out by  saying:  \"It's apparent  to me  from the questions  and discussions  in the  recent monetary policy oversight hearings  that  confusion has unfortunately arisen over  the  intent  of the  Federal Open Market Committee  in  characterizing monetary target ranges  for  1981  in general  terms.  I was,  for  instance,  disturbed that some members  of  the committee apparently seriously considered  that  the Open Market Committee was  somehow signalling a reluctance  to provide numerical  targets  for  1981  at  any time--a  thought  that  I can confidently say has  never entered our discussions.\"  The  letter then explains why we  chose  to  do what we did.  But  it  goes  on  to  say that it's  going to  be  terribly confusing  if  we try to  give all  these targets.  But  the key sentence would  say, if  I can  find it: \"Abstracting from institutional  influences and the questions  cited above\"--and  all  those  questions are  about the  fact  that we  don't  know what  the  impact  of NOW  accounts  is--  \"we find  it  difficult  to gauge the  continued  significance of  the  money market  fund growth and we need to  learn more  about  this  apparent  shift  in M1  demand.\"  So  abstracting from all  of  those  things,  \"the general  intent  of  the  FOMC  at  this  time can be  summarized as  looking toward a reduction  in  the  ranges  for M- 1A, M-1B and M2  on  the  order of  1/2  percent next year.\"  The  letter would go on to  say  that  if we  translate  that  into  specific targets, we have  to  allow for all  of  these  shifts.  And then  it  gives them some numbers,  but  it  says  don't take  these numbers  seriously--they're  all illustrative  and we will  have  to  look  at  them again.  All we are trying  to  say is  precisely what we  already  said and  I repeat  the language  that we have  already used  in the  report  and  in  the testimony. That's what  should come  through and not  all  of  this  arithmetic, and we hope  the  arithmetic doesn't  confuse you.  We  fear  that  it  might,  but since you  insist upon  asking for  [numerical  targets]  we  are giving them to  you.  That  is  the  way I would propose going.  I could send out  a  draft  of  this  letter  to you this  afternoon.  We  don't have  to  take any formal action right now, but  I wanted to  relay this  concern,  the formal  request  of  Senator Proxmire,  and my sense  of how it  should be handled.  I basically don't  think we  have much to win  in  this  game by sitting on  our present  position, because  I think genuine confusion has arisen among some  of  those who are most  supportive  of  our  general policies and approaches.  It's  unanimous  in  that sense.  So  that  is [my recommendation]  in  substance.  Now, I had tentatively put  in this letter a sentence  that  speaks of  a reduction  \"on the  order of  1/2 percent\"  [on  the  ranges]  for M1  and M2.  But  also  there  is  a sentence saying  consistent with that, at  this very early stage we  think  there probably shouldn't be  any reduction next year in  [the  ranges  for]  M3 or bank credit, because  in  a recovery period those measures  tend  to be a little higher  relative  to M1  and M2  than  in another  kind of  period. So the  letter  just  speaks vaguely of  [those  ranges]  being unchanged. I don't  think that's  necessarily  essential, but  that's again  talking somewhat  in the  abstract.  Also,  the  letter  in great  tortuous detail goes  over how it  would look, not  in the abstract  [but]  on  the basis of arbitrary assumptions as  to  NOW accounts  and money market  funds  and so forth.  That  is  the  essence  of  it,  and I  [would be  interested in]  any reaction you have  at  this point  to  the general  idea.  If we want  to go  ahead  in  this  fashion,  I can send this  [draft  letter]  out.  I don't  think we need  further conversation  if it's  generally acceptable, but we would need a formal vote at  [some]  \f7/25/80  point,  since the  [decision]  is being put  in numerical  terms.  I don't mean a formal  vote  this  afternoon, but when you  see  the  actual--"], [4, "It  says  that  at great  length.  I could  read  this  to  you and--"], [6, "The draft as  it  is  now goes  on about  five  pages.  And the  reason  it  goes on  is  that  it  keeps  telling  them how arbitrary these  assumptions  are  on NOW accounts  and--"], [8, "--and how we are going  to  have  to  look at  it  all  again  in February.  It  says  that  in  three  different ways."], [17, "Yes,  this  talks  about  on  the  order  of 1/2  percent,  so  that's  the presumption.  It  is  not meant to  convey rigidity on  those  kinds of  questions because  the  tone  of  the  whole letter  is  not to  convey great rigidity.  But  it  specifically says nothing  about  that  point.  The key sentence  is  the one that  I read."], [19, "Yes.  I think in  the  absence of  saying  anything else that's  the  clear implication."], [21, "Well,  we have had a little discussion of that  informally here--not  with the  Committee but with Mr. Axilrod and others.  We  could  do  that  for  the M1  ranges very easily  in my opinion because  they are  2-1/2  percentage points  [wide]  now.  To make a range wider than  3 percentage points  for  the  others  I think would look  a little peculiar.  I just wonder whether  it  would undermine  the exercise  a bit.  I have,  as you know, traditionally been  in favor  of wide  ranges.  But  there's  a point  at which I begin gagging  a bit at their  significance  if we make  them  too  wide."], [23, "I don't know.  I puzzled over  that.  My  conclusion was--whether it's  in an  appendix or the  letter--give  them a lot  of  language  to  keep reiterating  the  arbitrariness of  these adjustments.  So,  I don't  think just  a sentence  saying that  is  going to  carry the  flavor.  And  I really believe we want  to  get  that message through somehow.  What  the  letter  actually says  is:  Arbitrarily assume  that  2-1/2  percent comes  out  of M-1A into  M-1B and that  2 percent,  I think,  comes  out of  savings  deposits  into M-1B.  And this is  just  the arithmetic:  If  we  lower  the range  by 1/2  percent and  then make  those  two  adjustments, we have an M-1B range  of  5 to  7-1/2 percent.  It  looks  high.  And that  is  my concern.  Just  looking  at that range  for M-1B, the  key aggregate  number,  it  is  raised significantly  from  this year.  [The  reaction could be  that]  the Federal Reserve  is  going  to  hell  with an inflationary policy.  Now, it brings the M-1A range  down  to  0 to  2-1/2 percent."], [26, "Just hang on,  Ernie.  I'm  listening  to  Tony Solomon  on another phone and  I'll  tell you what he  said afterwards."], [29, "Well,  it  is  quite possible we  could write  a letter--I'm just  thinking out  loud here--that is  instead quite brief.  It would note  all  this uncertainty that  has arisen,  the essence  of what we  are  saying, and translate  that  into the  1/2  percent  \freduction in  the  ranges  for  M-1A and M2  in  the abstract.  And I could say  I am attaching an  appendix which  [discusses]  these further adjustments.  That may be  a way to do  it.  It's  the  same  in  substance; it's  just  lifting out  2 pages  of  this  letter and putting it  into an appendix."], [31, "There may be.  Then the  letter  itself  would only speak about  the  1/2  percent with qualifications  around it, and  it would  say look to  the  appendix to  see  this more  or  less arbitrary  translation into the  other numbers."], [33, "Let me go  backwards, here.  I take  it  the  rest  of  you didn't  hear Tony's  comment."], [35, "He was  kind of  seconding Henry Wallich's proposal  to  put part  of  this  [lengthy letter]  into an  appendix.  And you heard what  I said,  I'm sure.  He  just  thought  it  might be less confusing, from  the  standpoint of  the press,  to  have  the  elaborate specific  targets  developed  in  an appendix.  We  can certainly  look at that,  and it may be better.  Now, Mrs.  Teeters  just  raised a question on how many  qualifications  I had around the  1/2  percent.  Well,  it  talks  about that  general  statement  [as]  one  of  the clearest  and most useful indications we can make and  [notes  that]  the  numerical  ranges might ultimately prove to be  a source of  confusion rather  than clarity.  It speaks  about  the  institutional  change.  The  key sentence,  again,  is the  one  that  I read.  It  says  \"on the  order  of  1/2  percent\"  and the letter at various  points  talks  about uncertainties,  including the public's desire over  the  longer run to  hold money balances  in relation to  income."], [38, "I do  have some  language here  [about  that].  What  is  essential  is  that  our intention to  lower monetary growth ranges over  time toward rates  consistent with virtual price  stability should remain clear.  There is  language  [regarding our  intent  to]  \f7/25/80  review this.  Here's  the  sentence  I'm  looking for.  This  is  close to the  end as  it's now written:  \"In accordance with usual  procedures, all  of  the  ranges will have to  be reassessed in or before next February.  The extent  of  downward adjustments  in  the  ranges not  only will be  influenced by the  technical  factors  noted above, but  also  will be conditioned by the  speed with which inflationary bias  in  labor and product markets  can be reduced, and by  the  likelihood, therefore,  that the  economy  can make  an orderly adaptation to  curtailed money growth. The need for public policies  other than monetary policy to  move in a complementary way to  speed  those  adjustments was,  of  course,  the essence  of my testimony before the  Committee.\"  Now, that paragraph obviously could be read either way, as permitting more downward adjustment  or conceivably none.  I think it's probably the way  I would like  it  read.  I must  say that  if  we make enough progress  on price stability, we'd go  faster.  But  I think it's  formally neutral  in its wording.  We  are  caught  in  a box, obviously.  Looked at  from one point of view  the  1/2  percent doesn't  sound  like much.  If  somebody  says: Hell,  the  inflation rate  is  10  percent and at  best  they  are going to get down to  0--and the progress will be measured by  the decline  in the money  supply--they have  20  years  to go.  On the  other hand,  if  someone says  something  like  0 on M1 monetary growth--or to  have  a range, let's say 0 to  3 percent--is ultimately where we  would end up, we are not all  that  far  from  it.  It's  just  these darn  lags  that have made it look  so  far  off."], [40, "Yes."], [44, "Did you hear Governor Gramley?"], [46, "Well,  the question was  simply how much  sentiment is  there  for  1/2  to  1 percent--the  question that  Ernie Baughman raised.  And Governor Gramley  said he prefers  the  1/2."], [50, "Any other comment?  \f7/25/80"], [59, "Did you have a question?  Well,  it  sounds  to me as  if  we  are  at  1/2.  I think there  is  a real  problem here  in that  it will  seem very small  to people who are  unaware  of  some  of  the technicalities.  The sentence  I read  to you may help a bit  in explaining  that, but  I guess  that's where we  are  stuck."], [61, "Yes.  I think you'll  find this  letter  reiterates everything!  Well,  I think we have enough guidance;  it's just  a question  of whether we put  the  specific  ranges  in  an appendix or  the  letter.  I may try  it both ways  to  see which I like better.  We will  get  this out  to  you in  a day or so  and then  I think you can respond in  a formal  way, so  that when we have numerical  [ranges]  we can say there  has been  an actual  vote  on this.  I don't  think we need that  today;  you might as well wait until you  see  the  language.  And I will  also call  Messrs.  Proxmire  and Reuss.  I presume  they will be happy, but  if  they tell me  they  really don't want anything more, despite what  everybody said,  I may drop  this  whole thing.
