It's  very frustrating to me personally.  It's  hard  to know what  to  do  about  it  but  I'm  thinking and will  continue  to  think [about  that].  As  you have heard me  say before,  this  kind of  thing can be extremely  damaging  and I don't  how we can operate  with some confidence, given  the necessary  lapses between meetings  and announcements,  if  we're  subject  to  this  kind  of  thing.  I don't know what  else  I can  say  other than  that  I'm  thinking about  it  further.

We  indeed have  [new  data]  and they're  somewhat different-- Steve will  go  over  them--than what  we were  assuming.  I don't  see anything here  that  casts  any question about  our decisions.  And I don't propose  to  raise  that,  myself;  the new figures  don't  require  any decision of  that  nature  in my view.

It's  obviously  a very big  figure, partially and hopefully [to  be]  offset next  week.  But  the  arithmetic,  as  Steve  suggested,  is for  no  further  increases  or  decreases beyond next  week, which  [means the  July increase]  about  balances  the June  decline.  We're  not very far  above where  we want  to  be, but  the  risks  look a  little  different at  this  point.  And M2  seems  to  be  running high.  In  the  normal  course of  events,  I would be  inclined  to make  one  of  the  operational adjustments  we  talked about  at  the  last  meeting and  lower  the nonborrowed reserve  path.  The presumption  is  that  borrowings  will  go up;  we'll  go  toward the position  Mr. Rice  expressed  at  the meeting, and  toward what  the  staff  saw as  consistent.

We'll be  someplace  in between.  I don't  think we  can wait  very long.  We're  just  operating in  the  context  of  the  decision  that was made.

We're talking  about  the  next  reserve  week."], [79, "Did you want  to  [reaffirm]  the  long-run range?"]], "MR AXILROD": [[10, "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  data  for  the week  of July  1st  that  were published right  after  the  FOMC meeting were about  $2-1/2  billion higher  than we  thought  at  the  time  of  that meeting, based on  the  preliminary  figures.  The  data  for  [the  week ending]  July  8th  that we  are  going  to  publish today will  show an increase of  $6.9  billion.  As  you probably recall,  at  the  time  of  the  \f7/17/81  FOMC meeting we  had projected, without any data  in  hand, an  increase on  the  order of  $4-1/2  billion,  in  part  because of  the  accelerated social  security payments.  But  the  increase, as  you  see,  is considerably higher.  The  preliminary data  for  the week  ending this Wednesday, July 15th,  suggest  that  part  of  this  [extra bulge]  will come out,  and we  are  looking  for a decline  of  $2-1/2  billion.  But even with  that  decline,  that would  still  leave  the  level  of M-1B  in the week of  July 15th some  $700  million  above where  the  target  path had put  it  last week.  And it  would leave  the  level  for July 8th  some $1.7  billion  above  where  the  target path  for  last  week had put  it. So,  we're running  somewhat  stronger  on M-1B.  Without  changing  the nonborrowed path at all  and given  the  shortfall  in borrowing  last week to  $1.3  billion, this  implies  a borrowing  level  in  the current  week and next  week of  $1650  million.  That's without  without  doing any adjustments  to the  nonborrowed path, just  holding  that  and  letting  the natural  course of  the  figures  work through.  Meanwhile,  because  the  Committee  clearly  indicated  its  concern about  M2,  I should  update  the  Committee  on  that  aggregate. The data we now have,  which include preliminary data  for  the  July  15th week, suggest  to  us  that  savings  deposits  are  less  weak  than had been estimated as  consistent with the  path, that  money market  funds  are considerably  stronger,  that  overnight  RPs  are  stronger, and  that Eurodollars are  stronger.  We  don't  [calculate M2]  weekly, but  that would give us  growth  in July of  close  to  11  percent  in  contrast  to  the 8-1/2  percent  path.  In  essence,  the nontransactions  components  of M2, which had been  targeted, so  to  speak,  to  grow at  a rate  of around  8 percent  with M2  as  a whole  growing  at an  8-1/2  percent rate  given  the greater  growth  the  Committee was  permitting in  M-1B in  that month, look  as  if  they're  expanding at about  an  11  percent  annual  rate-- similar  to  the way  they had expanded  earlier in  the year.  That's  how they look  at  this  moment.  So, we have  greater  strength  in M2  and we have not made  any particular adjustment  in  the path  as  of  this  moment for  that."], [12, "Well,  the  confusion  goes  back  [to  how we  constructed the  path]  and  I should be  clearer.  The Committee met  on Tuesday;  we  got new data  on Wednesday;  and we  constructed the  path  on Thursday night  on  the basis  of  the  new data.  So,  I should have  added, Mr.  Chairman--the numerology here  just gets  excessively complex--that the  June  level  on which the  current  path  is  based is  $400  million higher  than  the  June  level  at  which the  Committee was  looking.

So,  relative  to  the number  we used  in constructing  the path,  given the  increase  in  the  June base,  you're $1.7  billion above.
