{"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER": [[1, "The meeting can come  to  order  and we can  approve  the minutes."], [4, "Without  objection, the minutes are  approved.  I want  to propose  a change  in  the order  [of  the  agenda] this  morning.  I'm going to  have to  leave  at about  10:00  a.m.  for about 45  minutes  to  an hour, unfortunately, so  I want  to  start  off with the  business discussion.  I've had appointments  with the President  on  and  off  and he  came up with one  this  morning and  I decided  I'd better  grab it  while  I can get  it.  You can go back to  do the  reports  on foreign currency  and domestic  operations  and so  forth at  that  point.  And  then I can be  back for  Mr. Axilrod's presentation, hopefully.  So, why don't  we  start  off with you, Mr. Kichline?"], [6, "Well, we have  a situation continuing  where forecasted downturns  by a  lot  of  people haven't materialized.

That's  just  it."], [10, "Mr.  Black."], [15, "I think that's probably right."], [18, "It's  a little  troublesome because we had  higher  levels  of  rates  than this  in  the  fourth  quarter and we had an  8 to  8-1/2  percent  increase  in the GNP  immediately  following."], [23, "Mr. Balles."], [31, "Mr.  Corrigan."], [33, "Mr. Winn."], [35, "Mr.  Roos."], [37, "Mr. Ford."], [42, "Mr. Doyle,  let's  get  the  depressing side  of  this."], [44, "Did you get rid of  your dry weather, Mr.  Guffey?"], [46, "Well,  I'd better  run  in  a second.  We have  heard  from all  the presidents;  the governors  have  all been  silent. We'll  leave  that  to  you.  And you  can go over  these  other  [agenda items]."], [48, "Good.  By what?"], [50, "Count on  the  lady bugs!"], [193, "I don't know where  you are  [on  the  agenda].  I understand that  you have  to  ratify  the  transactions.

When  I came back,  I thought you had finished your coffee break.  I see the  coffee  is  there.  Do you  want to  hear  from Mr. Axilrod so  you can chew over a doughnut and his  comments?  Maybe we'll  do that,  if  you don't  take  too  long."], [214, "Is  that  all  there  is?"], [216, "I wasn't quite prepared  for you  to  stop  so  soon, but why don't we  have  the  coffee break.  [Coffee break]"], [217, "We  have several  alternatives  laid out  before us.  They  take  as  their  low point where we were  last  time  as converted  [for]  the  remaining part  of  the period, due  to  the unexpectedly high  [M-1B]  growth rate  in April.  We are,  as  you know, at  the midpoint  of  the  range  for M-1B adjusted.  The only  comfort  I feel  about M-1B  adjusted is  that we  estimate  these  shifts  about  three different ways  and they all  [produce]  more  or  less  the  same  [results]. They are probably all  wrong, but the  different  ways  of  estimating come out more or  less  the same.  In  the  last meeting we picked what  is  the equivalent of  \"C\" this  time,  which I believe  [involves  growth  that]  is low in  the range.  However,  if  I recall  correctly,  the actual  M2  came in a little  less  than  we projected  the  last  time,  right?"], [219, "And as  you  see,  bank credit  has  sneaked  just  inside the  range and M3  remains  above  its  range.  While  there  is a lot  of week-to-week change,  I suppose  that  is  the  trend on  the absolutely most recent  money supply  figures,  if  there  is  such a  thing as  a trend  for  about  3 weeks  or  4 weeks  [of  data].  That's where we stand.  Alternative A would  leave us  theoretically  running in  the middle  of  the  range  for M-1B  adjusted but would leave  us  above, although closer  to,  the ranges  in  the  case  of  the  broader aggregates-- only slightly closer,  I guess,  in  the  case  of M2.  That  seems  to me  to be  the  range  for  our discussion.  Who would like  to  start?"], [221, "I think it's  fair  to  say  the  range  of  outcomes  is  likely  to  be  somewhat  wider  than the  ranges presented to the  Committee.  So,  as  usual, we  are moving  in  a direction of  bias  and risk  averseness  or whatever.  I agree  that  any of  these  results  would not be  disturbing in  and of  themselves.

We have had  a 5-1/2  percent  [M-1B]  target for  the quarter,  and  the alternative  that's  consistent  with  that  is \"C.\"  But  we had a big  increase  [in M-1B]  in April.  My  forecast was that  it  might not  look  too good or  that people might  not want  to  say that  we  should go  all  the way to  \"C,\"  which  implies  about  1 percent [M-1B  growth  for April  to  June]  by  the  time  we state  it  in  the directive.  Stated  flatly, we're certainly  around the  \"B to C\"  area; both  the  Committee and  the non-Committee members,  looked at individually  or collectively,  are  split  someplace between  \"B\" and  \"C\" with  a little  flavor of  between  \"A\" and  \"B.\"  The question  I would raise  is  whether we  can reconcile that  part of  it,  and  I'll  get  to  the borrowings  and the  other  issues  in  a minute.  If  you  look at  the way the  record has been  stated historically,  the most  consistent way is that  [at  this  point  in  the quarter]  we'd put  in  a growth rate  for April  to  June."], [317, "Well,  it  means  through June.  We next meet  at  the beginning  of  July, don't  we?  I wondered, when  I looked at  it, whether we could  even put  in a growth rate  through July.  I thought about  it  after  the  Bluebook was  prepared.  But generally we  go  on  the theory--maybe  it's  not  a good theory--that  we set  something  for the quarter and then  review it  at  the middle-of-the-quarter meeting.  We can get  some  of  that  flavor--I  don't  know whether  this  captures  some of  the  [concerns]  or not--with  a slight  rewriting.  The  draft directive  says  \"In the  short  run  the Committee  seeks  behavior of reserve aggregates  consistent with a  substantial deceleration of growth  in  M-1B  from April  to  June\"--and that's  shift-adjusted--\"to  an annual  rate of  ___  percent\".  This  language  is  all  the  same  so  far. Consistent with  this  approach, we presumably  could put  in  something like  the  \"B\" number  or we could put  in  [the  \"B\" number and]  \"or lower, as  may be  consistent with  the objective  for M-1B adopted by  the Committee  on March 31\"  and then repeat  that  number.  If  we  want  to  go that way, I think it  says  that we  are  between  \"B\" and  \"C.\"  And then we'd put some  M2  number  in  there.  We  could go  that way or we  could just  put  in a lower  number--we  can't put  in  a much  lower number--and say  \"or lower.\"  To  get  absolute consistency with what we did  last time,  we would  [have  to]  say  \"C\" or  lower.  Last  time  the directive simply  said  \"5-1/2 percent  or  somewhat  less,\"  so  theoretically we could do  that.  I confess  to  my own bias  of  rather  liking  some  feeling in the directive  that  we  are  not going  to hit  a precise number, because we  are  not going to  anyway, and giving some  flavor of  which way we want  the  errors  to  go.  \fWell,  let  me  just  get  a very preliminary reaction  to  something  like  that.  Let me  say specifically that  we  are putting  in  3 percent but with  the period April  to  June.  In  any case, we want a substantial  deceleration--I'm just  talking about M-1B--to an  annual rate  of  3 percent or  lower,  as  may be  consistent with  the  objective of 5-1/2 percent  for  the quarter  that we adopted last  time."], [319, "It  just ties  it  back to  what we said  before as  to what  [M-1B  growth for]  the quarter should be;  it's  an element  of  continuity and it's  not  really a lower limit.  I don't think we  can  control M-1B that  closely,  so  its  purpose  is  to  give  some idea of  what we  mean by a little  lower,  I think."], [321, "Yes, it's  shift-adjusted.  We are  all  talking about  the  shift-adjusted number--or  I am--at  this  time."], [324, "Well,  I guess  I disagree with  that.  But  it's  a question  of  approach.  My  [point]  on  this  is  that we are  not going  to hit  a precise number anyway, so  it's useful  to  give  the direction  in which we would  like  to  go  from whatever precise number is put  in.  Or we  could be completely neutral.  If  if we  put  in  something as  high as  3 percent as  the center  of  gravity of  the  Committee,  I would interpret  that  as  not neutral;  we'd rather come  in lower  than higher.  And  that's  what I'm--"], [326, "Well,  this  is  the question.  The  question  obviously was  not asked this way, but  let me  ask the  question. Suppose we have  a happy day and those  late  May figures  come  in  rather low and it  looks  as  if,  indeed, we may come in  lower  than  1 percent for  May and June with  interest  rates  not  rising and maybe  falling under those  circumstances.  Would  the Committee consider  that an unhappy result  or a happy result?  I myself would be  rather happy. And, therefore,  I would not want  to  be pushing out money  if  the growth rate happened  to  come  in,  let's  say,  at  zero  in May and June,  if interest rates  were already  stable  or declining."], [329, "I'm not  sure  I follow your concern.  I  would argue that  without  some wording of  this  sort--not  that  the wording is  all  that  critical--the  Committee would begin getting worried that  money growth was  coming  in  too  low and would want  to raise  it  a  little.  And  I'm not  sure we want  to  do  that."], [331, "Well,  it  wouldn't be.  But  in  that  case  it's  not consistent with  the 3 percent  either."], [334, "We  can look  at  this  language  if  you want."], [336, "Yes,  I think that  is  what  it  is  meant  to  convey, if  we put  the  number  3 percent  in  there.  There  is  nothing  to say we have  to  put 3 percent  in  there;  we can put  in a different number."], [338, "Yes,  but  then  it  says  the previous  target  was  5-1/2  percent or  less."], [340, "I would read it  the way you  did and maybe  even add one  of  the negative  numbers."], [344, "Well, what's  consistent?  We are  talking  about  a very small  number  for two  months.  That's  the  problem I always have with  these  things.  One  thing  I'm sure  of  is  that  in  one meeting out  of  about  twelve we may be within  1 percent of  one of  these numbers.  There  shouldn't be a comma  after  \"percent\" anyway.  It would be  \"   percent or  lower.\""], [347, "How we  set  this up depends  upon where  the  borrowings  go.  But  I do not  read this  at  all  the way you are now reading  it.  It  says  3 percent or lower  and it  refers  to  the consistency.  I read it  the  way Mr.  Partee reads  it."], [354, "Forget about  the  language at  the  moment.  My interpretation of  this  language,  as  I say,  is  very much  the  way Governor Partee suggested.  There's no point  in  saying that we  are not going  to permit  something above  3 percent.  We don't  know.  Maybe  it will  come  in above  3 percent.  We may set  the borrowings  at  $3 billion and it  could come in  above  3 percent.  Forgetting about  the  language, is  this where we want  to be?  Will we resist pretty darn  hard growth above 3 percent but be  quite  relaxed below 3 percent down  to  zero  or  I  \fwould say even below zero,  depending upon how things  develop in  the market  for this  2-month period?  Is  that  what we are  trying  to  say?"], [356, "I must confess  that  I don't  know what  the  operational meaning of  that  is  for M1-B  [growth].  All  I have  are forecasts  that are  right within  [a  range of plus  or minus]  10  percent."], [359, "Well,  I don't  think any  construction  allows us  to  deal with that.  What  allows  us  to  deal  with that  is where we  go  on the  borrowing assumption right now.  I don't  see  people being all  that  gung ho  on the  borrowing assumption  that  the staff  says is  consistent.  I'm not  sure  it  is.  The  staff  estimate may be  too high.  I think we  ought  to  get  some  understanding of what we  are talking about  here, but  the  only  difference  it  makes  in  the real  world is  what number the  outsiders  read six weeks  from now or when it's  all in the past  anyway.  We can obviously put  in 2 percent  here.  That goes  squarely  in between."], [361, "Well,  we will  get  to  that  in a minute."], [363, "We  can write  this more  straightforwardly perhaps  by just using  a sentence  that  has  a number  in  it  and  then go on to  say  that a  shortfall  in  growth for  the  two months  from  the rate specified above would be  acceptable.  That's  saying  the  same  thing in two  sentences."], [365, "Well,  this  is  partly a question of whether  we  want  to  tie  it back to  the objective  for  the  quarter that  we  set earlier.  I don't know whether  it's  a good idea  or not.  But  if  we follow this  idea  that we  set  a target  for  the quarter  and we  shouldn't forget  about  it  six weeks  later,  it's useful  to make a reference."], [368, "I don't  think we  can  do  that  here  with  the  rest  of  this.  We  can't  say 2 percent, which  is  higher  than  the previous  target,  and say it's  consistent."], [370, "We  can put  in a range.  I have  thought  of  that,  too."], [373, "The  only fear  I have  of ranges  is  that we  can put  in  a range of  2 to  3 percent  and we won't be within  it  anyway. And people  attribute special  importance  to  a range as  a whole.  That's my only objection to  a range."], [375, "You're going  to  get  all  excited if  it's  less  than  1-1/2 percent?"], [379, "The effort  is  to  get  some sense  of  a range  without  saying we have a range  that's  only one  or  two percent  [wide]. That  [kind of  range]  sounds more rigid  than I think we  can afford to be."], [382, "I am inclined  to  feel  that we  ought  to  get  something  in  there  [that  gives  some  definition to  the]  \"or lower.\" It's  something of  an experiment,  but  I think  it  may be useful experimenting  to  see whether we  like  referring back  to the  quarterly ranges  in  these  interim meetings.  We may get  in  trouble  because sometimes  we may not want  to  refer back  to  them.  But  if  we don't,  we don't.  In  this  case I think  it  may be useful  [to  do  so].  This  other language may be better,  saying whatever growth rate  we want  to  use-- perhaps  an  annual  rate of  2 or  3 percent--and maybe putting  in  an  \"or lower\"  and whatever  the consistent  number  is  for M2.  I don't  know. [We  could say]:  \"A shortfall  of  growth  in M-1B  from the  2-month rate specified above  would be  acceptable in  light  of  the  rapid growth  in April  and  the objective  adopted by  the Committee  on March 31  for growth from March  to June  at  an  annual  rate of  5-1/2  percent  or  less.\" This  other way  tried to  compress  it  into  one  sentence;  maybe  that isn't  wise."], [384, "No, I'll  get to  that.  Let's  take  it  one  thing at  a time."], [386, "Well,  as  nearly  as  I can see  at  the  moment,  I think we  are  only  left with whether we  take  this  or  make  it two  sentences.  The question is  whether to  put  in  2 or  3 percent to start with.  It  doesn't bother me  much  either way."], [389, "Actually, now the  way it's  written here  it  just  says  3 percent and then  the next  sentence  goes  on  to  say a shortfall  would be  okay."], [392, "Now, we  could say  \"3 percent  or  lower\"  and  say  that  a shortfall would be  acceptable because of--"], [394, "Well,  I think we  are  close  to  this  two-  sentence version.  The question at  the moment  is  the borrowing.  Not everybody mentioned  it;  a minority mentioned  it.  Of  those who  did the levels  suggested ranged  from  $2 billion to  $2-1/4  billion.  The  latter was  the highest.  We  had some  at  $2 billion and  some  at  $2 billion plus--$2.1  to  2.2  billion.  A  lot of  people didn't  say anything.  So, I think it's  clear that  we start  out  at  least  at  $2 billion, which  is about  $150  million above where we are.  The question  is  how much,  if any, to  go  above  the  $2 billion at  the  start,  with the  recognition-- particularly  if  we start  around  $2 or  $2.1  billion--that  if  [M-1B growth  in]  the  latter half  of  May comes  in high, we  are going  to  raise that."], [396, "Well,  I'm not  quite clear where we  are  at  the moment.  I thought we were  at  least  at $1.8  billion."], [398, "We  know where  it  has  been this week  so  far.  We only have  two  numbers.  What we  were  aiming  for this  week at this moment  on  our present track  is  $1860  million,  I take  it.  And we have been  averaging $2 billion,  so  $2 billion  really  isn't  all  that much of  a change.  It's  a little higher  than where we  are  aiming right at  the moment,  but not higher  than where we have  been.  I don't  think $2 billion  implies  all  that  much of  a change,  so  we may want  to  make it  just  a shade higher  than  that.  But  a  lot  of  people  haven't been heard  from.  Whom do we have  for something between  $2.1  and $ 2.2  \fbillion--$2.15 billion, I suppose,  just  to  split  that--which  is  about $300 million  higher  than this  week's  figure."], [408, "Well,  let me  just  try $2.1  billion  and  see  whether there's  a consensus  for  that."], [410, "Well,  I'm asking  for a vague  consensus  now.  How many are happy with  $2.1 billion?"], [412, "Well,  I wasn't  getting that  precise.  I  was  trying to  get to  some  kind  of  consensus.  I take  it  there's  no overwhelming happiness  at  $2.1 billion.  I don't  know which direction to  go  from the  $2.1  billion."], [414, "I'll  try it.  Does  $2 billion make people  unhappy?  I have a lot  of  no  hands raised here.  Does  $2.2  billion make  people happier?"], [418, "Is  $2.1  billion acceptable?  We'll  remain  very tentatively  there at  the moment.  Let's  [discuss]  the federal funds  range.  First  of  all,  the question has  been raised whether we should have  it at  all,  I guess.  Did you hand out  these  other--"], [420, "I have  a series  of  reworded  sentences.  I  have one  reworded sentence  that assumes  we keep  it;  let me  see what the  change  is  from what  we now have.  Maybe Mr. Axilrod can  explain it to me."], [427, "Well,  I think we  ought  to  discuss whether  we  want  this  at  all,  which  I guess  is  the question you're  raising. I'm  obviously at  the hands  of  the  Committee, but  I don't  find any difficulties myself,  and I see  some  advantages,  in  saying  if  interest rates move  extremely enough the Committee  at  least wants  to review  \fwhat  the heck  it's  doing.  I  think that's  the question.  If  we  really think  that,  then  I'm inclined to  feel  that  we ought  to  say it.  If  we don't  think that  and  genuinely don't  think this  is  anything  to  be worried about,  then we  [could]  leave  it  out.  Now, we  could write  this to  say that  if  either  the money supply  is  moving well  outside  its range or  if  the  federal  funds  rate  is  moving well  outside  its  range, we  would consult.  And  I think  that  is  true  in a  sense.  The difference  in the  implication  is  that  if  the money supply is  running outside  its  range, we  know what  to  do  if  it  doesn't  involve conflicts with these  other things.  We know what  to do  in the sense  of  the general  direction."], [429, "Well,  I'm not  so  sure we would consult  if  it  were running  outside  the  range;  it  depends  upon how  far.  It's likely  to  run  outside  the  range  in the  short  run,  so we would make  all these  adjustments  in borrowings  and  stuff  that  we talk about."], [431, "Now, if  it  went  far  enough....  What  I  think disturbs people  is  that  we would want  to  look at  [our  decision] again if  it  implied a very large  change  in financial  conditions  that was not  necessarily contemplated at  the  time  of  the meeting."], [433, "It  could.  It  can be  anything we want.  At  the present  time,  I am  somewhat  allergic  to making  that  big a  change in  the  directive because  it  will  then give more  significance to  it than  I think it's  worth."], [435, "Well,  I think we  can say  that.  But  the  explanation you gave  I'd be perfectly happy to  put  in  the general discussion as  background for  this."], [437, "Oh,  it's  for more than a couple of  days,  I  think, under the current directive;  we've done  that historically."], [439, "Well,  I think  they've been doing that  anyway, but  I agree with you."], [441, "Right.  I think  this  comes pretty close.  We can quibble about  the  language, but  the  intent  of  this  is  to  be consistent with what we've been saying."], [446, "Well,  I'll  tell you.  What  I don't  like  about  that--and we're  talking about  nuances--is  that  it  has no connotation  that we're following  a reserve path.  That  sentence  in  and of  itself  can be  interpreted to  mean that we  really set  this  federal funds  range as  a range."], [449, "Well,  there  are  two questions.  Forgetting  about  the market,  there  is  just  the  question of  what  the  Committee wants  to  say and whether  it wants  to  have  a consultation.  If  we do, then  I think we  ought  to put  it  down.

The  last  time  I expressed a  lot  of vague  fears, which  I guess  have  all come  true,  that  we have gotten higher interest  rates  and  a stronger economy  and everything seems  to  be going  in different  directions  due to  that.  Money seems  to  affect  interest  rates, and  interest rates affect money;  but neither  one seems  to  have  much effect  on  the economy.  So,  I have  some real  questions  about how we  should go  about doing  this.  In  addition,  I have  the  same  thoughts  that were  expressed here  a little  earlier:  That  we are putting a  lot  of  pressure on various  parts  of  the  economy  and that  it's  going to be hard to  get  out of  this without  some  kind of  financial  crisis.  The one really strong feeling  I have  is  that monetary policy alone  won't do  the  job  for  us. But we  don't  have much choice.

However,  I am  also  getting very worried about the  cumulative effect  of  this  [monetary policy restraint].  If real  GNP revises  up  even  to  8 or  8-1/2  percent,  there  literally has been no  real  growth  in  the  economy for two  years.  That  to me  says that  monetary policy has been working quite well  in  restraining  the economy  from any growth.  We've never had a period  like  this  in which we had  literally no  growth  on average  for  that  [length of]  time.  I think we have  to  continue  to  restrain  [the  economy].  However,  I am very worried  that we will  restrain it  to  the point  that  we will get interest  rates  that  are  going to  be  really  damaging to  all  segments  of the  economy.  Interest  rates  may be  [low]  after  tax, or  in  real  terms, but  they are  still  contributing  to  cost  and  are  creating,  I think, some  of  the  upward pressure on prices.

I find  the unemployment rates  projected, with no growth,  rather unbelievable  also.  More  importantly, it  seems  to  me that  the  level  of  borrowing  is  now becoming very crucial  here.  At just  under $2 billion we have  already put  a great deal  of pressure  on the market.  We  have  shot  [short-term  interest]  rates up  3 to  5  full percentage  points, depending on which ones  you look  at.  If  we move borrowing up another  $1 billion,  the  [proposed  fed  funds  upper  end of] 22  percent  isn't  going  to  hold.

I don't hear  of any  signs  of  collapse  there despite  the  high cost  of credit  to  farmers.  Aerospace, electronics, and so  forth are  still going along very strong.  In short,  what  continues  to amaze  us  is  the resilience  of  the  economy despite  high  interest rates.

Two  lumber companies.  One  is  a great big one  and one  is  a small  one.  And if  there's  any industry  in the  country, along with autos,  that  should be  screaming for  relief  from high interest  rates,  it  seems  to  me  it  would certainly be  the  lumber  industry.  Yet both of  these guys  are foursquare for solid monetary restraint, enough  to  get  the  job done  in  bringing inflation down.  When  their  support  this  kind of  restraint  in terms  of what  its doing  to  their business,  the  explanation is  along  the  following lines:  They have  two choices, both of  which are bad, but  one  is worse  than  the  other.  One choice is  to price people out  of  housing temporarily through high interest  rates;  the other,  as  they put  it,  is  to price  them out  of housing  indefinitely and permanently through ongoing double-digit inflation.  So,  even  looking at  their own  long-run self  interest,  they favor monetary restraint  and are not ready to  throw me  out  the window or out  of  my job--if  they could--because  of what  we are  doing to  their businesses.  I find that  rather  instructive.  quiz  them on how they can"], [77, "No, but  the  small  lumber  company  is  surely  making no  money."], [79, "It  will be a while, but  they're not  facing  bankruptcy."], [208, "I wonder  if  I can  just  ask one  more  technical  question of  Peter.

As  I recall,  the last  time  I heard  this  discussed you  said that  in  the  following period  \fyou adjust by only half  of  the undershoot or overshoot, which doesn't seem  to  be working out  all  that well,  as  far as  I can  see.  Is  that still  the practice?"], [265, "There  are a  couple of  things, Mr. Chairman,  that  have  led me  in  the  same  direction  as Mr.  Solomon  and Governor Rice. We're beginning to  wonder--and  it's  obviously speculation rather  than proof yet--whether  we  aren't witnessing  some  downward shift  in  the demand  for money, along the  same  lines as  occurred in  the  1975-76 episode,  because  of  the  institutional  changes affecting business deposits with  this  surge in money market mutual  funds.  Some simulations  we have  been doing  over  the past  five months  show  that M-1B  is  now well  below the  level  that  would have been  indicated by historical demand  relationships,  and I'm  really beginning to  wonder whether  there  hasn't been a downward shift.  I don't know what  studies you have  been doing  on this,  Steve.  But  if  that  is  going on, and  I suspect  it  might be,  the  shift-adjusted range  that we have  set  for ourselves could actually give us more expansion  than we  counted on when  we picked  out  the  range  at  the beginning of  the year,  even though we  are  now, as  of  April,  in  the middle  of  that  shift-adjusted range. And  that  leads  me  to  lean more  toward  \"C\" than  \"B.\"  One  thing that  gives  me real  pause about  coming out  there  is  what  Governor Gramley  as well  as  Steve  and the  staff remarked on earlier  today:  Namely,  it  seems  to  indicate  that we'd have  to keep interest  rates at  a very high  level  for  a very long time.  We  need some  real  weakening  in the  economy in order  to  hit even  the midpoint of  our shift-adjusted M-1B range.  But, again, our  staff  has been doing some work on  the  differences between  the  liquidity preference model  of  interest  rates and  the more traditional  loanable  funds  theory  \fof  interest  rate  determination.  And the  net of  that  is  that,  except for  the very short run,  interest  rates  are  going to  be determined more by  credit market  conditions  than pure money demand  equations  [would suggest].  This  leads  us  to  conclude  that  it's  distinctly possible that  we can  get  a slowdown in money growth this  year from  last  year, along the  lines  of  the midpoint  of our  shift-adjusted range,  without keeping interest  rates  that  high  that  long,  and  to  a point where we would see  somewhat more real  economic  growth  in  '81  than  the  Board staff  [has projected]  and almost  about  the  same  real  economic  growth, close to  3 percent,  in  1982.  Admittedly, a lot  of  this  is  conjectural and  one might  even say speculative;  but  taking both of  those  reasons together tilts me  toward alternative C."], [367, "I think  it  would be  less  confusing  if  we  followed what Tony suggested by putting  in  2 percent and dropping the words  \"or lower.\""]], "MR PARTEE": [[25, "How is  housing out  there, John?"], [27, "I know, but  you don't get any feeling of  uplift?"], [29, "Yes."], [60, "Well,  I don't  think there's much downside  risk  either,  except  if  there  should be  some unexpected  financial difficulty that would  lead to  it.  And  that's  always hard, indeed  impossible,  to predict or  to  time.  I would agree with Lyle  that  the  governor on  the  \f5/18/81  economy is  monetary policy.  And with emphasis  on  the  aggregates, what we're  really talking about  is  how high interest  rates  will  go.  But, of course,  as  they go  higher,  if  they should go higher,  the  small business  problem and  the problem with housing and with  automobiles and so  forth will  get  greater and greater.  Indeed,  that's  the disturbing factor about  the economy.  There doesn't  seem to  be  too much effect  in the  soft goods  sectors  and  certainly no  effect  in  the defense  area. There  is  a strength  that could  end up in a bad crash, I think, in nonresidential  construction.  I agree with Willis  that  there  are  a lot of problems  that  could develop  there because  there's an expectation that prices will  go higher and  that  the properties will  appreciate. If  they don't,  then  there  is  no basis  for  the  financing being done  on them.  So,  the  concern that  I'm beginning  to  have  is  that  to achieve the  9 percent nominal GNP  that  Lyle speaks  of,  we will  have no activity  to  speak  of  in  some sectors  and hardly reduced activity in other sectors.  The differential  impacts  are going to  be very difficult to  deal with.  Henry made  a good point a month or  so  ago,  in a speech  that I guess  he  didn't deliver, which  is  that  there  are  two tiers  in  terms of  interest  rate effects.  Those who  don't  pay 46 percent  tax  rates  are hurt  a lot  more than  those who  do pay 46 percent.  That's very consistent with the  notion  that  small  business is  complaining, because  they  [don't]  pay 46  percent tax  rates.  And it would be  very consistent  for  any firm that  is  in a loss position to  be badly hurt.  It  reminds me  of  the  [adage]  that  the  worst  thing a bank can have  is  money--that  the  bank  should get  so  that  it  doesn't  have taxable  income.  The same  thing  is  getting  to  be true  of  debt  burden. The worst  thing you could have,  if  you have  any taxable income,  is  not to  have  a debt burden because  then you don't  have  any tax write-off. So,  I agree  that we're  in a fairly narrow range with very little chance of  a sizable decline  in  the  immediate picture and a good control  over the  expansion because monetary policy  is well  along the road toward being restraining.  But  as  to  the  effect  that  this  will have  in  the  longer run,  I'm certainly not prepared to  say at  this point."], [62, "Yes,  we  could  get  a sharp  change  in  expectations.  The people who  are  expecting prices  such as  real  estate values  to  rise will  stop expecting  them to  rise.  And then  suddenly what  didn't  seem to  be such  a high  interest rate  before will  seem extraordinarily high,  and that  could happen very quickly.  But  one just  can't predict when  it  will  happen.  By the way, though, Tony,  I do  think  that  [our  policy]  is  having  a restraining  effect  on  the economy.  It's  clear that  housing  starts are not  going  to  stay  at  1.2 million;  they're  going to  drop below it.  And  that's very restraining. That's  one  of  the biggest  industries  in  the  economy,  and it's  largely due  to  interest  rates  that  housing  activity is  as  low as  it  is.  On inventories,  I agree with  Frank.  He  said inventories  are  very, very lean.  Why  are they  lean?  It's because  interest  rates  are  so  high that  everybody pays  great  attention  to  keeping  inventories  down.  The automobile business,  which  in  the  last  two or  three 10-day periods  has been below 6 million  in  domestic  sales,  is  4 million  off what  the industry has  been accustomed  to.  That's  a big  cut  in  output  in  GNP.  \fSo,  interest  rates  are  restraining  the  economy;  and the  higher they go,  the more  they will  restrain."], [68, "It's  the  other way around."], [76, "They're not  facing bankruptcy."], [78, "That's  what  I was wondering."], [86, "I don't  think the  savings  banks  are really  quite  that  close.

But  I would say in response  to  Tony  that what we should  do  is  to  set our money growth  course  the way we would like  to have  it.  If  it deviates  from that,  then we'll  automatically become more  restrictive in  terms  of  interest  rates  if  we need to be  tighter,  or  less restrictive if  we need to  be  easier.  So,  I don't  really  see moving all  the way down to  alternative C  in  terms  of  the  specifications. What would we like  to  have develop  in terms  of  the  aggregates?  That's really the  question we are being  asked.  And  in my view  \"A\" holds  us right  along the mid-section of  the M-1B range.  It's  a little  ample  on M2  and M3  and,  therefore,  there might be  a case  for  alternative  B  in order  to  adjust  for having been  over on  the broader  aggregates.  As for  the  numbers  for  the  aggregates, expansion of  3 percent  in M-1B  for April to  June  is  quite reasonable;  it's  a very modest  expansion  and would be  a  quite acceptable  outcome.  Now, we don't know what  interest rates might  be associated with  the 3 percent  increase.  And  if  I understand the meaning  of  the  funds  rate  range now as  the points  at which we're  to  have  a consultation rather  than points  within which  the Manager  operates,  I think we  might want  to  raise  that  range  in  \"B\" to 16  to  22  percent.  I can certainly imagine  the  rate  going  to  22 percent with no  trouble  at  all,  and  I don't  know that  it would be  \ffruitful  to  have  an  exchange  [of  views]  until  it  gets  to  about  22 percent.  But  that's  just  a  test point,  or guidepost,  or whatever you said earlier, Peter,  rather than  a  specification  to  the Manager.  There  is  one other point  that  I want  to  make now.  I think we  will be  in  as  much difficulty politically  if  there  is  weakness  in  the aggregates as  if  there  is  strength.  We  could quickly get  quite a reaction  from very weak growth  in  the  monetary aggregates,  and that  is not unprecedented.  Starting  in  the  spring of both  '75  and  '76,  there was a  surge in  the aggregates  that  was  subsequently reversed.  The fact  that  the  last  couple  of  occasions  haven't  [produced  that  result] doesn't mean  it won't  occur again.  April  is  still  an odd month;  it has a  lot  of  tax  transactions  in  it.  So  it  seems  to me  that we ought to be  in a posture where we can give  a little  if  the numbers  come  in weak as well  as  tighten  up a  little  if  the numbers  come  in strong,  and we  ought  to  do  it  from a neutral position.  So,  I could accept  the specifications  of  alternative A,  but  I lean rather  strongly  to  \"B\" as a conservative posture."], [244, "Well,  $2-1/2  billion  seems  a little  strong.

In  terms of  the  underlying demands,  the  suppressed demands,  given that  in  the short run  the capacity  to  snap back very quickly  in housing  and other  areas  is  so great,  I can't  see much of  a significant  downside risk.  The major imponderable  in  all  of  this  is  how much  financial  stress  is  really there  that  we don't  see.  We  focus  a lot  on  the  thrift  industry because we know a lot  about  it.

We  have more  than our  share  of frustrations  in policy here,  too.  We  just  got  through  revising up the money supply  a little  in  the  first quarter,  convincing  ourselves that that made more  sense.  But  now we  find  that  the GNP may be revised up more, so  we're  further  away  than we thought  we were."], [270, "We  have  a little  frustration,  too, with  respect  to  this  question of  how quickly the banking  system responds  to what we  do.  We  saw a classic  illustration of  that  in  this period here,  apropos  to  your  comment  earlier,  Governor Partee.  We  seem  to have  a situation where,  even when we begin to  firm  up, what happens for  a couple  of  weeks  is  that  the banks  sit  there and wait until Wednesday and cover  their whole position  on Wednesday.  And the  funds rate  doesn't  change  except  on Wednesday and then everybody discounts the  change.  And  then  for  a week or  two  after the banks  run down their excess  reserves and end up with deficiencies.  Somehow or  other,  in ways  that  are  not clear to  me,  it  takes  a couple more weeks  and we revise  away all  those deficiencies with  \"as-of\" adjustments.  Then finally, after all  of  those processes  have  run  their course, we begin to  see  some  pressure  either  in  terms  of  borrowing or  the  funds  rate, or both.  I will  also  confess  to  a  little continuing  sense of frustration about  the construction of  and subsequent adjustments  to the  reserve paths, which  comes  up again  in  this  forthcoming period. The Bluebook  indicates  that,  looking out  over  the April-June period, any of  the  alternatives  contemplates  a  substantial  acceleration in reserve growth  while at  the  same time  about  the  same  or less  growth  in money.  I don't  know what  all  that  means  except  that maybe we  don't know as  much as  we  think we know.  As  I suggested earlier,  there  are  some  risks  here,  and I  think we  have  to  be prepared to  take  some  risks.  In the  current circumstances  I come  out  somewhere around  \"C,\"  too,  partly because  I think the  economy,  if  anything,  is  stronger, and partly because  I think money growth  is  likely  to be  stronger  in  the  short run  than we expect.  And  finally,  like  Governor Rice,  if  we have  to  take  a bit  of a  slowdown or a decline  in  the economy, which we  may have  to  do,  I'd rather do  it  now than  later, partly because I think  it  makes more  \fsense  in  the  context  of hitting  the annual  targets  but partly because it  forestalls an  even  more serious problem that would occur  if  we  let [money growth]  continue to build up.

My  concern is  this:  I'm  inclined to  the view that whatever we  set we  are  likely  to  exceed  in  this  immediate  situation; and given  the  lags  in  the reaction process  both by us  and by the banks,  if  we  start  out  saying we would live  with 3 percent,  we could easily end up with  a quarterly growth rate  for March  to June  of  not 6-1/2 percent  but even more  than that.

Borrowings  and  the money supply  and reserves  and those  things  are  all  over  the  lot.  The  funds  rate  at least  is  unambiguous.  I certainly agree with  the  idea  of  trying  to get  the markets  and everybody else  to  recognize  the  de  facto  role  that it  plays.

How much  of that  is  inventory building  is not  quite clear, but  think about  what would happen if  automobile  sales  should pick up or--this  is hard  to determine--if  defense orders  start  to  flow to  a greater extent than they have previously.  We'd have  a really tight  bind with respect to steel.  The  second  thing  is  that  if you  look at  retail  sales  across the board, and  they have been very strong,  [our  sources]  all  report that  it  is  for  top-of-the-line merchandise.  The bargain  stuff isn't moving very well.  This  is  not  a feeling of  weakness  in my judgment  in terms  of what  is  happening  there.

But  retailers thought  sales  would tail  off  after  Easter and they are continuing quite  strong  even through last week, which is  a rather  strange phenomenon.  The  third point  I'll make  is  that  on John's  point  about  office building and other kinds  of  activities we may have  a bit  of  a booby-trap  in this  area  in  that most  of  those have been  financed  on construction loans  without take-outs  in some instances.  And  the question is:  With the  change  in  interest  rates, what  kind of  take-out  set-up  are we going  to have  for  some of  these things?  They went  ahead with the buildings  thinking that  if  they couldn't  find financing,  they would  sell  them.  We may have more  for sale  here suddenly  than some people have expected.

A  second point  is that  I'd be very happy if  somehow we could get  away from  the  check writing privileges  on  these money  funds,  because  I think we are exposed  there with the  funds  investing in  issues  that  could go  sour  on them.  We may have more  volatility built  into  this  than we  are thinking about.  The  third  is  that we  talk about  targets  as  if  they were  fixed and we  forget base-drift and a whole  lot  of  history  that goes  into  them.  I'm not  sure  that hitting  the midpoint of  our new range  is  what we really  ought  to  be  doing.  A  little miss  on  the  low side  might be more  helpful  than misses  on  the high side.  I'm disturbed by the M2  and M3  figures,  which  tend to  go on  the high side in  this  set-up.  On  the  other hand,  I have  some  sympathy with Lyle's point of  view in  that  I'd hate  to  see us  run the  rates  up  and then run them right  back down  again.  That  would not be very helpful  in  terms of  our  longer-run objectives.  To  take  a stance at  this  time,  I would be  content to  be  able  to hit  somewhere between  \"B\" and  \"C\" rather than to  set  a  target and  then be  all  over the  lot  in  terms  of  our performance.

The  tourist business  is  great.  As  for  the  steel  industry in  our area, surprisingly, after years  of  disaster around Alabama, U.S.  Steel  is planning to put  up a new plant  of  all  things  and employment is  rising in  that  industry.  In  our high-tech belt  that  is  developing around Atlanta and Florida,  the  high-technology industries  are  doing great. The  defense-related  industries  are  doing great.  In housing and  \fconstruction, surprisingly, while  activity is not  great, on  a month- over-month basis  it  is  up  and  on a year-over-year basis  it  is  up. Mortgage loan closings  are up;  we don't understand why, but  apparently they are.  The  agricultural  sector would be  all  right were  it not  for the  fact  that  everybody else  in  the country has  gotten rain except  us apparently,  and there  is  still  some concern about  the  lingering effects  of  the drought we've had.  The big area  of  worry is  in  the  financial  sector where, on  the banking  side,  our banks are  doing not  just well,  they're doing fantastically well.  Big banks  in Atlanta and Florida  are up 25,  30, 35  percent  year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter,  anyway you want  to measure  it.  But  there  are areas  of  stress.  I've been going  out, as Ed has,  trying to  get  closer to  the  individual  industries  and some  of the  particular players  to hear how it sounds  to  them.  The  thrift executives  are counting  [reserves];  they are all down.  I've now talked to  about  8 or  10  of  them  individually because  I made the mistake of  making a public  speech about  their problems a month before everybody else  did, so  I've been going around trying to  heal  the wounds and listen  to  them.  What  I hear  is  that they're  all measuring their survival  literally  in  terms  of  how many months  of  reserves  they have  left at  the current  rate.  They all  have  it  counted out  that way and they are in  a near panic state,  as  [the  Board]  will  hear when it meets with  its Advisory Committee  later  today or whenever.  Consumer  finances  are starting  to worry me  in  that we  see  more and more  isolated signs  of  stress  on the consumer balance  sheet tipping upward.  One of  the  biggest  industries  in  our area  is Equifax credit reportings,  for  example,  and  they say business  is  great.  There is more  concern  than ever about  the  credit condition of  the  consumer. The  collection companies  are doing great, which is  bad news  in  terms of  financial  stress.  Another  thing  that worries  me  is  that  we're starting to  get  some  evidence of  creative  financing;  as  a concept,  I think it  is very worrisome and  something we're going to  have  to  focus on.  A lot of  financial  balloons have been put up  in the  air where people are disintermediating  [from]  the  normal  lending agencies  and taking back paper on  homes.  That  is  done on  the basis  of very questionable  credit  standards or none  at  all.  And I'm starting  to hear more  and more people,  as  I talk to  people about housing  finance, talk about  possible problems in  the  area  of  creative  financing.  Finally, all  over  the  District  I'm hearing  from small  businessmen, especially dealers of  U.S.  built  autos  and various  other small businesses,  that  they are  actually paying 1 or  2 points  over  the prime rate.  They support  us  tremendously philosophically, but  they wish we would lower  interest rates  today because  their survival  is  in question now.  I haven't  been able  to verify how much of  that  is  true, but  every time  I go  out  to  a meeting or sit  down at  a rotary club talk or wherever people  get me  in  a corner and  I ask them:  \"Do you believe in what  the  Fed is  doing?\"  They say:  \"Terrific, you're  on  the  right track;  hooray  for you and Ronald Reagan.\"  Then  if  I ask how business is,  they say  it's  terrible.  They say,  for example:  \"It  costs me more to  finance a car on  the  floor  of my  showroom for one month than  I can ever  hope  to  make in profit, and  I'm not  selling  it  within a month.\" So,  my big worry would be  the  overall  stresses  and strains in  the vulnerable areas on  the  financial  side.  Overall,  I would  say the economy  in  the South is  moving  sideways.  We have  strong areas  that are  booming balanced off  by these  areas  of  weakness.

The  automobile industry is  still  in a very depressed  state  in  our District and its  influence  is  quite pervasive.

There now seem to  be  increased concerns  spreading somewhat  to  the  rural areas.  The banks  are  highly liquid, but high  interest rates  are discouraging borrowers  and we  tend to  hear more  and more  from this particular  sector recently.  The drought has  ended in  the Middle West  and it has brought with it  some rather interesting  revisions  in estimates  of  food price  [increases] for  this year, which are  expected to  be somewhat  less  than  the USDA projections--say,  somewhere  around 10  or  11  percent rather  than up  in the  11  to  12  percent range."], [310, "Mr. Chairman,  it's  very difficult  for me not  to  be  influenced by the  state  of  the  economy  in  the  Seventh Federal Reserve  District, particularly  the  credit-sensitive  industries,  which are  extremely depressed.

Just  over the  last week to  ten days we've gotten very good rains  and very general  rains. There is  some  good and some  bad news  to  that.  Along with the  rains was  some  very severe  weather;  and much of  the winter wheat,  which would be  harvested commencing in  early June  in  the  southern part of the  District, was  laid flat by the  hail and high winds.  So, the question  is  whether what wheat  survived will  result in  a good crop, beyond earlier expectations;  that  which was  flattened is  a total  loss. The  USDA doesn't  know what  is  out  there  and I don't  think  the  farmers can  tell.  Not  until  the harvest is  completed will we  know.  The  fact of  the matter is  that  the  outlook for  the  agricultural  sector probably is better at  the moment  than  it has been over  the past  sixty days, with the  exception of  the  red meat industry, particularly the  cattle industry.  There  has been a continued liquidation  of  breeder  stock, keeping meat prices down.  As  a result of  that  there  is  a loss  in  the cattle  in the  feedlot  area.  That has  to  end one of  these  days;  and when it  does,  we will quite  likely see  an  escalation of meat prices, which will  roll  into  [consumer]  food prices.

Conditions have  been very dry and as  a result  the  cattle have been  taken off  of  the range  for  two reasons.  One was  that  the prospect  for  keeping  them through  the upcoming  summer was not very good.  Secondly,  those  in  the  feeding business were losing  from  $75  to  $200  a head on  fat  cattle.  So,  they are  just  liquidating their breeder  stock.  Whether or not business judgments will  be made  to maintain  some  of  that  breeder  stock now that some  green grass  has  come  forth,  I don't know.

I'm primarily  motivated by a desire  to  hit  the  targets  that  we  set  earlier,  not because  they're  magic but  because that  would  tend to  avoid  the  same kind of  thing  that  happened  in  June,  July, and August  of  last  year. That  is,  things got  away from us  after one month  [of]  fairly  large [monetary growth].  We  say that  isn't  terribly bad, but when we  start piling one  month after  the  other, we then have  a very  small  chance  of hitting our targets  for  the  year.  Therefore, restraint  at  the moment  \fis  attractive  to  me,  but  I'm not  sure  that  I would go as  far as  \"C.\" The staff's  estimate  of growth  in M-1B  of  6 percent  or  a  little above in May under alternative B probably is  subject  to being  off by at least  100  percent.  That  is,  I think we  could get 3 percent  or  9 percent  in  May as  easily as  6 percent.  Thus, my prescription would be something between  \"B\" and  \"C,\"  with a borrowing  level  initially  of about  $2.1  or  $2.2  billion and with the  rather specific  instruction to the  Desk and  to  the  staff  that  if money growth as  it  develops  in May is  running above  6 percent,  the borrowing  level  should be adjusted upward promptly to  $2-1/2 billion,  [the  level]  I believe  the  staff would say at  the moment  is  consistent with  \"B.\"  So,  I am choosing numbers  for growth  in  the aggregates between  \"B\" and  \"C,\"  with  an initial  borrowing  level of  $2.1  or  $2.2  billion but  I would be prepared to  move borrowing up  rather  rapidly if  growth  in M-1B  starts coming  in above  6 percent  in May.

I think that's  what we don't want.  It seems  to  me that  consistency would best  be served by leaving  the language as  it  has been published in  the  directive, with an informal understanding in  the  Committee with the  Chairman  that  it  is  a consultation point  as  described  in the  record."], [492, "I'm more convinced myself, but  it--"], [499, "But we'd be  taking a risk  if  we do  that."]], "MR RICE": [[54, "I'll  start  off.  Much  of what  I've  heard from  the presidents  confirms  the  feeling  I've  had about  our current  situation. If  I had  to  characterize  the  current  economic  situation, I would say that  the economy  is  slowing  from a very high  rate of  expansion but  it is  not by any means  weak yet.  I say this  because  it's  hard to  see  any unqualified  indications  of  weakness.  Even  in  retail sales  we  see, adjusting for autos,  an increase.  And the  slowing  in  industrial production, while negligible, would actually be an  increase if  it weren't  for  the coal  strike.  So, most of  the  indications  of weakness --for  example  in the payroll  employment  area--are not  unqualified.  On the  other hand,  there are  some  fairly good  indications of  enough strength still  left  in  the  economy.  Business  fixed  investment  is still  strong.  And, of  course,  capacity utilization has  increased. So,  I would  say on balance  that  there may be  some  slowing but  it's  a slowing  from a very rapid rate  [of  expansion]  and the  economy is  not at  all weak at  this  point."], [106, "Scott,  does  the  Federal  Reserve have  any  independent  authority  to  operate  in  foreign exchange markets  apart from the  Treasury--or possibly,  in parentheses,  in violation  of Treasury policy?"], [109, "I understand  the political problem."], [111, "Legal  constraints were what  I was  asking about."], [114, "Do you mean  from  the Treasury?"], [256, "Mr. Chairman, this  kind of  economic  environment  is  one where most people  see  strength  in  the  economy and where  I would characterize  the  economy as  indicating a pronounced  lack  of weakness. It  seems  to  me  that  we may continue  to  see money growth  coming  in pretty strong.  And  in  this  environment,  it  seems  to  me the really basic question  is  how rapidly we want  to  bring M2  and M3  back to within  their  target  ranges--whether we want to  bring them back by  the end of  June  or whether we  are prepared  to wait  somewhat  longer.  My own view  is  that we  should try  to  get M2  and M3  back within their target ranges  as  soon  as  possible--that  is,  by the  end  of June.  And alternative C,  of  course,  is  the  alternative that  will do  that. Alternative  C,  if  we get  the  results  projected, would result  in all three  of  the  aggregates being within  their  target ranges:  M-1B at  the low end, and M2  and M3  at  the  top.  I think  that  is  important  to achieve.  If we had  an economy  that we  could be  fairly  sure was weakening  and  if  money demand was  slackening, we  could take  a  longer time  to  try  to bring  these aggregates  back to  within  their  target ranges.  But  in  the  current  circumstances, with recent  money growth having been  so  strong  and with  every possibility  that  strong money demand will  continue,  I would see  less  risk in  trying  to  get  the aggregates  back  [on  track].  Of  course,  to  pursue alternative  C would imply, as  has been pointed out,  substantially higher rates  than we have now and somewhat  higher  rates than we would anticipate  if  we pursued alternative  B.  That  is,  we would have  these higher rates  in the  short  run, or  at  least during  the month of  June and possibly longer.  However, by  the  fourth  quarter,  if  I read Appendix  II  [of  the Bluebook]  correctly, alternative C would yield lower short-term interest  rates and  alternative B,  if  pursued, would yield higher interest  rates.  So  it's  a question of  whether one wants  to  take higher  interest  rates  now or  in  the  fourth quarter.  I would opt  for taking them  now.  And  that would  lead me  to  favor alternative C.  A final  reason  for  favoring alternative C  right now is  that we  really are not  too  sure what we  are working with when we rely  exclusively on M-1B.  In  these circumstances  I think we  ought  to  attach more importance  to M2  and to  getting M2  back within  the  target range,  so  I favor  alternative C."], [577, "Why don't we  find out what people  can accept."]], "MR GRAMLEY": [[56, "I deliberately stayed out  of  the  talking  stage  and in the  listening mode because  it  seems  to me  that  it's  more difficult  than  I can ever remember  to  know what is  happening by looking  at  the  statistics  from here  in Washington and by using  the typical  technology of  forecasting, either models  or  judgmental  \f5/18/81  forecasts.  The  economy just  isn't behaving the way it used  to.  I think the  staff  is  basically right, however, that  we're  looking at  an economy that  is  quite  strong.  The areas  of weakness  that  we do  see-- and we  are  seeing  some weakness  in the  housing industry and the auto industry, which  is being reflected in  the  employment statistics  and to some degree  in industrial production--are  in  credit-sensitive  sectors. To  the extent  the  economy is  being restrained at all,  it's  being restrained by monetary restraint,  by very high  interest rates.  What the  staff  is  saying,  in  effect,  is  that  interest  rates will  simply rise however  far  they have  to  rise  to get  nominal  growth of GNP  down to  the 8 to  9 to  10  percent range  or somewhere  around there.  And I think the  only issue  is  whether or  not  the  staff's  forecast  of interest  rates  is  right.  The  staff's  forecast  of  interest  rates,  in comparison with  the major outside  forecasters,  leaves  no doubt  that outside  forecasters  aren't  anywhere close  to being correct  if  the staff has  the basics  [right]  on where  the  economy is  going.  The  staff has  interest  rates  on Treasury bills  continuing to  move up  through the last  three quarters  of  1982,  hitting  a peak of  around 17  percent;  they are moving up  gently but  continue  to move  up.  The  mean of  other forecasters  has  the peak of  interest rates  in  the  first  quarter  of 1981  and  coming down  to  about  11-1/2  percent by the  end of  1982. That's why I think we're seeing  a major difference  in what  forecasters see  for  the outlook  from now until  the end of next year.

This  is  a Committee  that  follows  a tough policy.  It's  only a question of  how  far we go.  I share  the general  view that  I believe prevails here  that  we're  dealing with a very strong economy and  that  our problem this  year  in  terms  of  the  \fmonetary aggregates  is  primarily making sure  that  we don't  overrun  the upper ends  [of  our ranges]  rather than  the other way around.  But  I want  to  call  the  Committee's attention  to  the  fact  that we have essentially one alternative  that  implies no  change  in money market conditions  and that's  \"A.\"  The  other  two  are both  tougher.  And if my sense  of  relationships  is  correct, the  borrowing numbers we're associating with  \"B\" and  \"C\" are not by any means  associated with the midpoints  of  the  federal  funds  ranges  that  we're  talking about  here. The present  level  of borrowing  is  less  than  $2 billion.  Under  \"C\" that would go  all  the  way up  to  $3 billion.  And if we go  that  far,  I think we're going  to  end up having a telephone consultation by next Monday, if  not earlier.  We have done  a lot  of  tightening  recently, and I think we ought  to  try to  keep  that degree  of tightness  and perhaps  go somewhat  further.  But  I wouldn't want  us  to  get  into a situation in which  if  some temporary weakness  in  the aggregates does develop, as  Governor  Partee  suggests  it might, we  would end up  running interest  rates back down again.  That would be quite unproductive,  if the Committee's  diagnosis  of  the  economic problem is  a correct  one.

Some  things  don't quite seem  to  fit  together.  For instance, we've had  this  strong surge  in  the  first  quarter,  which may be  revised up.  But  it doesn't  seem to have  led to  a great  increase  in capacity utilization;  it  may have  in materials but not  in  other areas. And it  hasn't  led  to  a reduction  in unemployment, as  one would  figure. Now,  if we are looking at  this  first quarter,  it  really means  that  GNP from here  on out will  be about  1 percentage point higher than  it would have been had GNP  grown at  something  like  3 percent or  so--spreading the  difference roughly over  the rest  of  the year,  or  dividing it by 4. So,  the  whole picture  is  somehow tighter.  And that  I don't quite  see reflected in  the capacity utilization or the  unemployment  figures;  but it  must  be  there.  I also am asking myself:  Why, in  an  economy  in which no  single  thing  seems  to be  outstandingly strong,  is  there  so little room?  Why, when we've  got  some distinctly weak sectors  like housing and automobiles, has  the  economy been expanding  so  rapidly? Is  it  because the  saving  rate  is  so low that  we're now at  a much higher  level  of  consumption than we normally would be  so  that leaves less  room in  the  economy for  other  things and  is  squeezing  things  out?

The  swaps are not  exclusively  for  the purpose  of  intervention anyway.  They can be for  the purpose of  a balance  of payments  financing in  a broader  sense. I think one can  say  that with  regard to  the  Swedes,  who have  a  fixed peg.  One can't  so  easily  say that  the  French have  a fixed peg with the  EMS,  too.

If  we don't do  that,  I think we will  have  continuing pressure  from high interest  rates  for  a long  time,  with  the  economy being held down by always bumping  [up  against]  the  admittedly very tight-fitting money supply ceilings.  I find that  uncomfortable  to  contemplate  for  the future.  So,  if we  could create  a little breathing space  in the  real sector,  letting  out  some of  that  steam that  built up during  the  first quarter,  I think we would operate more comfortably with  our existing targets  and in  the  long  run we'd probably have less  high  interest rates.  Conceivably, maintenance of  these high  interest  rates would give  us  this  [result]  anyway through  some  sort  of  financial  crunch. But we  don't want  to provoke  that.

To the  extent  that one can  [anticipate]  these things,  if  \"C\" will allow the  funds  rate  to  come  down later even  though  it  may mean  a higher funds rate  immediately, that's what  I think we  should aim  at,  i.e. somewhat  less pressure  in the  economy  for  the  longer  run.  I would say one  other thing.  Given  the way we  were surprised  by events  in  April, we  ought  to  examine  whether we  couldn't respond more  flexibly to  such  developments.  I realize  that means  responding to  the weekly  data  in  a way that  the  data themselves  don't  really justify.  Nevertheless,  it has  happened again  and again that we were overtaken by  events and, in  the  light  of  hindsight, probably would have wanted  to  move faster.  I don't recall  so  many instances  in which we  did move  fast  and  then regretted  it  or didn't  move  and  then  found that  that  would have  been the  right  thing to  do.  On balance,  I think our  failures  have been  on  the  side  of  actions  [that  were]  too  little and too  late."], [274, "On  the  down side  I do  have my  reservations,  yes.

The  Swedes  asked  if  it  could be  extended but  felt  they had no compelling reasons  at  this point  to  justify the  extension  of  that increase.  They did use  the  line  for  $200 million  and repaid, as Governor Wallich just  mentioned.  But  in recent months  they have  had a rather substantial  inflow of  funds  as  a result of  policy measures  they took early this  year,  so  it's  difficult  to  argue  for  a continuation  of this  increase  in  the  current  environment.  It's  a hypothetical situation rather  than an actual  situation.  Discussions with Mr. Solomon and Mr. Volcker suggested  that perhaps  we  should let  the increase  lapse.  I informed the  Swedish Reichsbank  that  it would lapse,  as  it was proposed that  it would last  one  year.  I told them, should they have  further needs  down  the  road, that  the availability of the  swap line  is  there  and that  if  they want  to discuss  an  increase again, we'd be  happy to  discuss  it when  they  feel  they have a compelling case.

That was  when we were  in  an active phase of  adding countries  to  the  list.  We haven't  added anybody since.  I think  the criteria are  more what  the problem is  that  we are facing at  the  time and what  the  financial  interest is  to  the United States.  Our interests  are much greater--certainly they were back in 1978  when we had the  last  increases--with  the deutschemark,  the Swiss franc,  and the Japanese  yen.  Those swap  lines were  increased at  that  \ftime.  So,  it's  more  in response to  the  situations we  face.  We  do still  review them;  and  the Board staff  remember the  criteria  and bring them up  from time  to  time when we  are reviewing the  size  of  the  swap lines.  In  the  case of  the  Swedes,  it  turned out  that  on  these earlier criteria,  if we had continued at  $500  million,  then there  might have been justification for  some of  the  other Scandinavian countries  to come  in  and ask  for increases.  So, we  still  keep  the  criteria in mind, but the  size  reflects more  the pressures  at  the  time we are dealing with  them."], [153, "Well,  it would have  to  be the high;  it will  go  down from the  high by  $200 million."], [155, "Collecting  interest  on our balances."]], "MR TRUMAN": [[137, "I think  that's  right.

And because of  that  we were  going  to be  imposing on the banking  system  a demand  for  even  greater borrowing as  we  got  further  into April,  which in  itself  looked as  though  it  was going  to  be exerting significantly increased reserve pressure without  the need to  make these discretionary, if  you will,  downward adjustments  in  the nonborrowed reserve path.  We were  looking  for borrowing  to have  to  rise up  to  the $1.6  or  $1.7  billion area, well  above  that  initial  $1150  million level,  as  we  got  further  along  into April."], [184, "Well,  those were  just  technical  adjustments  due to  the multipliers."], [186, "I think  it  would have  taken  [steps]  that  would have  had to be  done  in March."], [188, "Yes.

There were certainly  losses  taken, mainly in  early April because  they had  some  big  [positions]  at  the  end of  March.  But  our impression  is  that  losses  were  taken by big, well  capitalized dealers. They were  unhappy, clearly, but they were not  put into  a state where they  couldn't  function.  There  were some  smaller  [problem]  situations, not  among the major primary dealers  but, as  I said, among  fringe operators.

We have  not heard of terrible calamitous problems  there."], [209, "Well,  in  the  current three-week  subperiod,  we went beyond  that kind of  adjustment and moved  the nonborrowed path more in  relation  to  the  overshoot.  Initially we appeared  to be running about  $550  million above on total  reserves,  and the  initial downward adjustment  in the  nonborrowed path was  $250 million.  Then  a week later,  it  looked as  if  we were running over by  $375  or $400 million and a further  downward adjustment was made in  the  nonborrowed path because  of  that.  There was also  another adjustment;  in  the May 6th week we  had deliberately accepted some  shortfall  in nonborrowed reserves  because borrowing had been  running higher  than  expected.  It was kind of  the aftermath of  that  super  tight  week at  the  end of April.  So,  another  $100  million or  so  downward adjustment was made  in the nonborrowed path  for  that  reason.  In  total,  the downward adjustment in  the nonborrowed  reserve path relative  to  the total reserve path was  $485  million, which in  this  case was  somewhat more than  the  amount  by which total  reserves  were running above  their path."], [397, "The borrowing  that we  are  aiming  for--the  borrowing consistent with this week's  nonborrowed  [path]--would be about  $1860  million.
