We may want  to  make a decision.  Let me just  say in  a preliminary way that  there  is  not much we  can  do about  it  right  at  the  moment but these  money supply  figures have  been plaguing us  in  terms  of revisions.  We have  known this  for  some  time  and it  has  just  gotten worse.  It's  absolutely clear,  in my judgment,  that  there  is  a systematic bias  in  these numbers.  When they go  down, all  the estimates  are  successively revised down.  And when  they go  up, all  the estimates are  successively revised up.  This  [pattern]  has cumulated over a period of  time  [and]  has  become  quite  serious  in my judgment.  Now,  I don't  know what  theoretical  reason  there can be  for  this.  I don't  think there  can be  a theoretical reason.  The  [errors] should be  random  unless we are  getting bad  reporting.  The  only plausible  explanation I can see  is  that  early reporters  are  not reporting  the right  numbers  in  some  cases.  I don't  know, perhaps  they report  last  week's number  or  something,  so when they are  in an  up trend  it  is  always  low and when they are  in  a down  trend  it  is  always high.  But  I will have  some people here,  as  soon  as  they get  out  from under,  organize  some  way to  look at  this.  I suspect  it's  going to have  to  be  done  by  looking very carefully  at  the  individual bank level to  see whether  there  is  any  systematic bias  in  reporting by  some of the banks.  I don't  know any other way  to  go  about  it,  but we are looking  into  it.  Did you  know a characteristic  is  [that  we have had big revisions  shortly after  our meeting]?  Maybe we  shouldn't have any more Federal  Open Market  Committee meetings  so we  can't  have  an eye  on money supply numbers  that we  discussed  at  a meeting!  That's  a part  of this  general  upward revision  syndrome.

The  kind of borrowing assumptions we  were using convert,  without any discretionary changes,  into  something like  $1.9  or  $2.0  billion.  The question of  a discretionary change is  at  issue certainly.  But even without  that,  if we stick to  the minimal  \"holding steady\"  on the nonborrowed  reserve path, we have a level  of  borrowing that  obviously puts  into jeopardy the  17  percent  funds  rate  ceiling.  I would just propose,  as  a holding action at  the moment anyway,  that we move that  to  18  percent,  subject to  review next week  if we  have  to  do  it."], [14, "I'm afraid those projections have had  virtually no  informational  content  in the  past 4  or  5 months."], [16, "Yes."], [19, "Well,  that might depend upon how this next money  supply  figure  comes  in.

We have  a decision on  the  reserve  path and we will have  another consultation next week. This  may be  a very  interim decision.  Just  in  terms  of  this  general experience--apart  from  statistical  and estimating  and  other problems-- it  seems  clear  to me  that  the  real  operating question here  is  what we do  with the  discount window.

All  they do  is  pass  the pea around among themselves;  they know what  the rules  are.  So  one  bank borrows  one week, and  it  says  I am not going  to borrow for  a few weeks,  we'll  let somebody else  borrow.  So  we  get no  real  pressure  on any particular bank because  it's  just  a question  of  whether they buy more  federal funds  this  week or  less.  We  just  don't  have the  situation  that existed 20  years  ago  where a bank got  into  trouble  in some  sense  and more  or  less  had no  alternative  to  borrowing other  than to make portfolio adjustments.

They just  change  interest rates."], [68, "That  is  right, among  other things.  Okay,  we may be back  in  touch, but  for  the moment,  that's where we  are. Thank you.  Happy Thanksgiving.  END OF  SESSION"]], "SEVERAL": [[3, "Yes."]], "MR AXILROD": [[5, "Well,  Mr. Chairman,  as you  suggested,  immediately following  the meeting we had a considerable upward revision in the money  supply  data, measured by M-1A.  For  the week of [November]  5th we published a  level  that  was  $1.2  billion higher than what  was  implied by the  growth path adopted by  the Committee,  and for the week of  the  12th we had a  level  $1.8  billion higher.  So  the markets  [saw]  an  increase for  the 5th--the  final  number--of  $2.9 billion  and a  further  increase  of  $1.8  billion for  the  12th.  The  \f11/26/80  preliminary data we  had for  the  19th had suggested no change  from the level  of  the  12th.  The data we have  as  of about  an hour  ago, without nonmember banks available,  suggest  a downward revision.  [The  numbers] suggest  that we may show a drop of  $1-1/2  billion  from the week of  the 12th  for  M-1A and a drop of  similar magnitude  for M-1B.  Even with these  latest  revisions, money growth will  be running above  the  total reserve path adopted by the  Committee.  As  of yesterday,  it was running about  $400 million above  on a weekly average basis,  and this increased demand for  total reserves was  pulling  [up]  the demand  for borrowing.  The amount  of  borrowing was up  from the  $1.5  billion initially assumed to  $1.9  billion.  We have not  made  any downward revision  in  the nonborrowed reserve path  to  take  account of  the increase  in total  reserves at  this point,  as we  normally do not  do that  this  early  in  a period.  In  any event,  as  I say, we now have had the  first  sign of  a downward revision  in  the money  supply.  Whether  it will  hold up, Mr. Chairman--"], [7, "Only time will tell.  With borrowing running  recently around  $1.9  to  $2 billion, the  federal  funds  rate has moved up.  After  the discount  rate was  raised on Friday, the  funds  rate moved up  to  around 16-1/4 percent  on Monday.  It  had been running at around 16-1/4  to  17  percent  and now, most  recently, it  has been running between  17  and  18  percent.  The  average for  the week to  date is  17  percent.  Yesterday it  was  17.28  percent and  it was  running very high  today, on Wednesday, the  last  day of  the  statement week--17-1/2 to  18  percent--and then moved above  that  later.  Mr. Chairman,  I think that  very briefly updates  the  Committee  on  the  aggregates and related reserve  and money market conditions."], [12, "We were  in  the middle  [of  those estimates]  before we  got  this very recent  data.  Our estimate  for M-1A growth  for November was  on  the  order of  9 percent  or a little  higher, and for December  it had  been around 1-1/2  percent.  Our estimate  for M-1B was  \f11/26/80  around  12  percent  for November  and  close to  3-1/2  to  4 percent  for December.  Whether  these  latest  data will  cause  any  further downward revision  to  that  depends  on  the week of  the  26th,  for which I just don't  have  any data.  If  they prove  to be  somewhat weaker  also,  I suspect  the  December number will  revise  down, because  the  latest data in November will be lower  and that will  tend  to  carry through somewhat and  lower  the December  average  level.  But  that's  highly tentative, President Eastburn."], [21, "Yes,  the  implied borrowing literally  called  for in  the path  is  $1.9  billion.  And given  the way  the  federal  funds  rate has  been running,  [a  funds  rate  of]  17  to  18  percent  ought  to  be generally consistent with  that.  But  if  the borrowing were  to  rise significantly higher--if  the money supply  came  in  stronger--then of course  there  would be  a question about  the  18  percent  itself.  I might also add that  last  week we  had an unusually  large amount  of borrowing from banks over  $3 billion in  size.  Virtually half  of  the  borrowing was  from  them, and  they are  the  banks more prone  to  try  to  avoid  the window because  of  the surcharge.  So  it  may be  that we  are  getting more pressure  from the  surcharge  than we might  have  expected.  That may abate but,  again, I'm not  certain."], [63, "I don't  think there  is  any particular  concentration by District.  As I say,  the  only  thing we noticed, particularly last week, was  that  very large  banks borrowed  a  little more  than usual,  but borrowing by the  smaller  banks  continued very heavy.  I might say that  over the  past  four weeks,  Mr. Chairman,  [one statistic we monitor]--the  average number of  weeks  borrowed  in  the past  13  weeks--has been creeping up.  It's  one  indicator.  It's  up  to 4.2 weeks;  and  if we  do  [the  calculation]  by size  of  bank, it  looks  as if  the  large banks  are very  close to  the  sort  of  national guideline that had been put  out, which would indicate  that  some will  be  subject to  pressure."]], "MR STERNLIGHT": [[9, "I have nothing very interesting.

The October  level  of  nondefense capital goods orders  is  little different  in nominal  terms  from the  average in  the  third quarter,  so we  don't perceive that  a great  deal  is  happening  that  differs  from our earlier expectations  on new orders.
