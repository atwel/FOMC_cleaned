In the  Board Room we have all  members  of  the  Board except  Governors Gramley  and Wallich, as well  as  Ed Ettin,  Jim Kichline, Ted Truman, and other members  of  the  staff.

The money supply, M-1B  anyway, has  been rather weak.  We have reduced  the reserve path  to  some  extent,  as  [M-1B growth]  got  below whatever number we put  in  the  directive.  What was that--3  percent  for--"], [6, "It  was  3 percent  or  lower,  as  you  recall.  Up until  now we've reduced  the  reserve path somewhat  to  reflect  the \"or lower\"  part  of  the  directive.  There  is  a question  of whether we should continue  doing  that,  given  the  current  situation,  and  I don't think we  should.  I'm not  sure we  require any decision  on  a  directive here  in a  formal  sense--I'm not  inclined  to  think we  do--but  I  thought it  would be useful  to have  an exchange of  views  and a mutual updating. So,  why don't  we  have Mr.  Ettin  bring us  up  to  date  on where the aggregates  lie  and where  interest  rates  lie  and  then we'll  have Mr. Sternlight  comment  on  the market  situation."], [8, "As  compared  to  the  5 percent  or  somewhat  less  that we  specified  [in March]?"], [10, "Okay, 5-1/2  percent or  somewhat  less."], [12, "Mr.  Sternlight."], [14, "Mr. Kichline, why don't  you review  the feel  and tone of  the business  situation as  well  as  the  statistics."], [16, "Well,  the  overall  situation  seems  to me  not  entirely  unsatisfactory.  We're within no target  range,  if  you take  those  literally.  Some  [aggregates]  are  low;  some  are high.  The M1  numbers,  of  course,  are  somewhat  fragile  in  terms  of  their meaning with everything  that  is  going  on.  M2  is  just  above  the range,  M3  is further  above  the  range,  and bank credit  is  somewhat  around  the top  of the  range.  We're  going  to be  above  the  ranges  for  the second quarter, quite  clearly, on  all  the  aggregates  except M1  on  a quarterly average basis.  Interest  rates  have been coming down.  The  economy seems  to  be softening a bit.  I don't  think that's  wholly undesirable  in terms  of the  speed of  growth we had before  and  in  terms  of  expectations.  And I guess we're a  little  more believable  than we were earlier  in the  light of  recent  trends  in both  interest rates  and the aggregates.  Just  in the normal  course  what we would do  is  to  follow the path  that  Ed suggested  falls  out  of  the numbers, which means  somewhat  lower borrowings  for these  coming weeks--not  too much  lower  if  the money supply is  not weaker than projected.  But  if  it  comes  out weaker  than projected--and I guess  this  last  figure  is  somewhat  on  that  side--we'd have  borrowings down  in  the  $1-3/4  billion area  fairly easily.  That would develop, I suppose,  in  the next week really.  And in my judgment,  that  doesn't  require  any change  in  the  directive  or  anything else;  that's  just  what we're  following in  the normal  course  of  events. Let's  just  have your  reactions  to  that."], [18, "Yes.  This  implies no  discretionary  downward adjustment.  It  says  that  we're happy with where the aggregates  are  and we're not  encouraging any  further  downward adjustments,  so  to  speak."], [21, "Yes,  the  $200  million was  somewhat of  an  artificial  adjustment."], [23, "It's  the  $180  million  that  you've really  taken  out."], [26, "The multiplier  is  the  normal  thing.  \f6/17/81"], [32, "No."], [37, "Well,  I agree  with a  lot  of  the  technical  analysis you  provided.  I don't  consider what  is  happening very ominous;  I  think it's  rather happy."], [39, "Any other comment?  How many people do we  have  out  there?  Somebody must  be  commenting."], [41, "Let me point  out  a couple  of  things.  I  did  some  calculations--or rather  I had  some  calculations done.  If  we don't  look so  carefully at  these cones  that we're  so  fond of  examining but  at how we're  doing  in terms  of  trend, one  way is  to  look  at year- to-year  changes.  We are running high this year  relative  to  last  year. We have  had a couple  of years  of  decline  in annual  average  aggregate growth.  It's  going to  be very difficult  to  get  a decline  in  the annual  average  this year.  If we  ended up at  the midpoint  of  our M1 target--almost  in a straight  line  from here  on out,  but  only at  the midpoint--it would look  fine  in  terms  of  the  way we arbitrarily  set these  targets.  On a  fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, we  would end up with  6-1/4 percent  year-to-year growth or  something like  that. And last  year  it was  only--I  haven't  got  the  figure  in  front  of  me-- 5.9  or  5.7 percent,  something  like  that.  And  it's almost  certain  that the  M2  and M3  numbers  are  going  to  be  significantly higher  in year-to- year terms  than  they were  last  year.  I think that  has  some significance  apart  from presentational.  If  we  really are  working toward  lower growth,  it  may be  more meaningful  to  look at  annual averages  in  some  sense  than  to  put  all  the weight  on particular quarters, which  is  what  the  targets  do  somewhat  inadvertently.  I don't like  the  feeling myself  of coming  out  for  the  year with a higher average  growth  in all  these aggregates  than we had  last  year.  But that's  the way we're headed."], [46, "I'm not  sure  the  formal  directive  did  that,  though.  I don't remember  the wording, but  I think  it  was reflected in the  tone  of  the discussion.  I just  don't remember precisely how it  came out  in  the directive  itself."], [48, "Yes.  I don't  know about  the wording  \"take  some  of  the  sting out.\"  It  may  take  some  of  the  joy out."], [50, "Yes,  if  you  look at  it  just  in  the  narrowest perspective  from  the  last  meeting, M2  is  slightly below the limit  that we put  on  it.  But  if  you look  at  it  in  the broader perspective  of  the year  as  a whole,  it  is  high and  is  running above the  range.  M2,  according  to  the current projections,  is  only  slightly below the  figure  that  was put  in  the directive."], [52, "End  of  conversation?"], [54, "Okay.  Any more here  in Washington?  Well,  we will  proceed.  Thank you  very much."], [57, "Okay,  that's  it.  END OF  SESSION"]], "MR ETTIN": [[5, "For April  to June."], [7, "Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  Our  current  estimate  for M-1B shift-adjusted  is  for  a decline  of about  4.3  percent  in May and  [growth  of]  around  1 percent  in  June.  For the April-June period, where  the  target was  3 percent or  less,  our current estimate would be about minus  1-1/2  percent at  an annual  rate,  shift-adjusted.  That would mean that  for  the  March-to-June period, growth  in  shift-adjusted M-1B would be  about 3-1/2  percent."], [9, "5-1/2  percent or  somewhat  less."], [11, "If  that  June  level  held, M-1B would be  somewhat  below the  lower end  of  its  longer-run range.  Our current  estimate  for the  10th  of  June, which will  be published this  Friday, will  only be a couple  hundred million  above  the  large  reduction that  has  already been published for  the week of  June  3rd.  M2  has  also weakened, mainly because of  the  reduction  in M1.  We  have  a 4-1/4  percent  rate  of growth  in May and  are anticipating a  6-1/4  percent  rate  of growth  in  \f6/17/81  June.  If  that June  level  held, that aggregate, Mr. Chairman, would be just  above  the  upper  end of  its  longer-run range.  M3  has  been running considerably stronger,  as  banks have  issued large-denomination CDs  in order to  accommodate the  credit demands  that  they have been  facing. M3  in  May rose  at  an  8-1/2  percent rate;  in  June we're expecting  it  to rise at  a 10-1/2  percent rate.  That  aggregate would continue  to  be considerably above  the upper end of  its  range.  On  the basis  of  the June projection, and making various multiplier adjustments,  the  staff would anticipate  that  borrowing would fall  to  a level  of  about  $1800 million.  If  money weakened further in June, borrowing could  fall  to as  low as  perhaps  $1700 million.  In  the  intermeeting period  to  date virtually every interest  rate  is  below its  level  at  the  time  of  the FOMC meeting  and also below the highs  for the  intermeeting period, of course.  Corporate rates,  for  example, are  off  about  85  basis points since the  FOMC meeting and  the three-month bill  rate  is  down about 2-1/2  percentage points."], [20, "We've  taken out  $180  million  in the  first  four- week period, reflecting  the weakness  in  the monetary aggregates  that the Committee  was permissive  toward,  and  another  $200  million for overshooting borrowings  in  the  first week when there was  a very high demand for  borrowing.  That  was  offset  by a multiplier adjustment  of about  $350  million  that  went the  other  way."], [22, "That's  right."], [24, "Yes."], [27, "So,  essentially,  it's  $180  million  for the  weakness  in money growth."], [29, "That's  right.  It's  in  the  first  four-week  period.  We've  made no adjustments  for  the second  three-week period that starts  tomorrow."], [31, "No."], [33, "There are no  further  adjustments."], [35, "March to  June is  3-1/2  percent."]], "MR STERNLIGHT": [[13, "Well,  Ed has  summarized what  has happened to  a number of  the market rates.  That has  developed essentially as  the market has  taken heart  from observing the weakness  in  the narrow money supply.  The market  is  in  somewhat  of  a suspended state of  animation, though.  They've observed  the  funds  rate  hanging at  what  they regard as  a high  level--in  the 18-1/2  to  19-1/2  percent  range--and they're somewhat puzzled about  that.  And that  tends  to  temper what might even be  a stronger positive reaction  to  the weakness  in money supply and to some  of  the numbers in  the  economy that  suggest  softening as  well.  We are winding up  this week, because the banks  tended  to  borrow rather lightly early in  the week, with some  tightness.  Funds  were trading around 20  percent  today after averaging  around 18-1/2  percent earlier in  the  week.  I would think  that  there might  be  a considerable bulge in borrowing shaping up  for  today."], [17, "Mr.  Chairman, this  is  Sternlight.  May  I  just get  in  a clarification of  what Ed Ettin  laid out  as  the borrowing prospect  for  the next  three  weeks?  We were  talking about  it  earlier and when he  said  $1.7  or  $1.8  billion  for borrowing,  that was before the  downward adjustment  for  the weakness we've been getting  in M-1B."], [28, "That  $180 million  applies just  to  the  first  four weeks;  I don't  think that  it  carries  through."]], "MR KICHLINE": [[15, "Well,  it  feels as  though there's relatively  little  growth in the  current quarter,  following  the exceptionally rapid pace  of  expansion in  the  first quarter.  The principal monthly indicators  of activity rather consistently suggest a sluggish pace  of activity.  Retail  sales were revised downward in  April and are now on a preliminary basis  indicated to  have been  about  flat  in nominal  terms in May.  Auto sales  were  very weak  in April  and May, although they've shown a slight uptick  in  early June.  Nonfarm employment adjusted for strikes  has  been unchanged  for about  the past  three months.  And housing starts  for May are  reported to  have declined.  On balance, we believe  that  we  would not be  making much  of a change  in  our projection of  real  GNP  for  the current  quarter.  On  the price  side,  the numbers coming in  continue  to point  to  a rather  favorable performance,  judging from  the  PPI  and the CPI.  A good deal  of  the more  favorable  outlook in  the  recent past has been attributable  to  developments  in energy and food and,  in  the  CPI,  the homeownership component.  Other prices  have not  shown much movement,  although on average they  seem to  be  doing rather well  under  the  circumstances.  For  the deflator, we would probably be  making somewhat  of  a small  downward revision  in  our forecast  for  the  current  quarter."]], "MS TEETERS": [[19, "May I ask a  question?  How much have you taken  out  of  the  nonborrowed reserves  to  date,  Ed?"], [30, "Does  that  imply  that you're putting  the  $180  million back?"]], "MR PARTEE": [[25, "And  the multiplier  is  standard, so  that--"], [34, "There  are no  further adjustments.  This  is  Chuck  Partee.  I might  just  say, Paul,  that  I think your proposal  is  very sensible.  If  I understand  it,  we now are  looking at  M-1B  for April  to June  of  3-1/2  percent, did you  say?  And that  is  assuming that  there is  no more  shortfall."], [36, "Yes, March  to June,  the  three-month period in  our original  directive, which we  keyed back to  last  time  and for which the  objective was  5-1/2 percent  or  somewhat  less.  Well,  3-1/2 percent is  certainly somewhat  less  than 5-1/2 percent and may be a little more than  somewhat  less.  So,  it  seems  to me that we  are at  the  lower end of  the agreed upon path that we  talked about  and,  therefore, that  the growth  in nonborrowed reserves  should be permitted to  show through  in lower borrowings,  to  the extent that  that  occurs.  I would note  that my sense  of  the  [situation]  is  that  we've had a period  of  several weeks--it's not  just this week--in  which we  have had downward revisions  in  the expected money supply numbers.  As  I recall,  at  the meeting we  were  talking about May growth that was  considerably higher than  -4.3  percent  and June growth  that was considerably higher than +1 percent.  So,  we  are beginning  to develop this  somewhat  ominous pattern of shortfalls  from staff  expectations  that has  run  for a period  of weeks.  And  I agree with the point  that  you've often made that  those revisions  often  indicate  something as  to what  is  happening. So,  our problem  as we  look into  the  next month or  two, may  in  fact be rather  low-looking money numbers,  lower  than the  staff  is  now expecting.  I don't  think this  has  any of  the dynamic  characteristics of  last year when  [money growth]  went  off  so  very sharply in April, but  it  does  seem to  be pretty pervasive and  it's  a fairly  ex ended period of  weakness  in  the money behavior.  Of  course,  the market  rates are  reflecting that  by coming down, although we  resisted or  didn't pay much attention to  that market development  in March and early April because we  sensed  that  there  was  considerable  strength  in  the business picture.  Now it  seems  to me  that  the market  is  probably right because there  is  developing weakness  in the  business picture.  So,  I think we ought  to  do what  you say.  But  we  ought to  be  rather sensitive  now to significant  shortfalls  in  the monetary aggregates because  they're probably going to  be  reflecting shortfalls  in  the  economy."], [38, "To  this  point  I'm not bothered, but  I'm worried  about what  the  next  couple  of  months may  show."], [49, "But,  of  course, M2  is  fairly weak  for May  and  June,  too,  isn't  it?"], [56, "Was  there  anybody there  in  the  first place?"]], "MR ROOS": [[40, "Mr.  Chairman, Larry Roos.
